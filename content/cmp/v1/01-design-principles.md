# Design Principles

## 1. Purpose

Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) define a structured, transparent mechanism for documenting **how Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) are interpreted and consumed by specific sustainability reporting frameworks**.

These design principles govern the creation, use, and evolution of CMPs to ensure they:
- preserve the authority of reporting standards,
- make interpretation explicit rather than implicit,
- support reuse and consistency,
- remain non-authoritative and non-normative.

CMPs are an **interpretation layer**, not a compliance mechanism.

---

## 2. Separation of Authority and Interpretation

CMPs explicitly separate:
- **standards authority**, which remains solely with standards-setting bodies,
from
- **interpretive judgement**, which is documented within CMPs.

A CMP does not:
- define reporting requirements,
- override standard text,
- determine applicability or materiality,
- assert compliance or adequacy.

CMPs exist to make interpretation **visible and inspectable**, not to replace professional judgement.

---

## 3. Non-Authoritative by Design

All CMPs shall be treated as:
- illustrative,
- non-normative,
- non-authoritative.

Each CMP must clearly state:
- the standard and version it references,
- the scope of interpretation it covers,
- known limitations or assumptions.

No CMP may claim endorsement by a standards body or regulator.

---

## 4. Intent-Centric Mapping

CMPs map **from disclosure intent to framework requirements**, not the reverse.

Each mapping:
- references one or more CDI identifiers,
- documents how a framework requirement consumes that intent,
- avoids embedding framework-specific semantics into CDI or CERM.

This principle ensures that disclosure meaning remains stable even as frameworks evolve.

---

## 5. Explicit Documentation of Judgement

CMPs must document:
- interpretive assumptions,
- conditional logic (where applicable),
- optionality or dependency considerations,
- areas of ambiguity or divergence.

Implicit interpretation is discouraged.

Documented judgement:
- supports audit review,
- enables comparison across implementations,
- reduces unexamined divergence.

---

## 6. Version Awareness

Each CMP must explicitly reference:
- the version of the reporting standard used,
- the version of CDI consumed,
- the version of CERM assumed (if relevant).

CMPs are versioned artefacts and must be updated when upstream references change.

Historical CMP versions remain referenceable.

---

## 7. Scope and Coverage Declaration

CMPs must declare their scope, including:
- topic coverage (e.g. climate only),
- jurisdictional assumptions (if any),
- sectoral focus (if any),
- exclusions or partial coverage.

CMPs that do not cover a requirement must state so explicitly.

---

## 8. No Embedded Compliance Logic

CMPs must not encode:
- materiality thresholds,
- scoring logic,
- pass/fail criteria,
- enforcement rules.

CMPs describe **relationships**, not outcomes.

Compliance assessment remains outside the CMP layer.

---

## 9. Compatibility with Assurance

CMPs shall be structured to support assurance activities by:
- enabling traceability from framework requirement to disclosure intent,
- preserving references to canonical data,
- documenting interpretation choices clearly.

CMPs facilitate audit review but do not replace assurance procedures.

---

## 10. Extensibility with Discipline

CMPs may be extended to support:
- new framework versions,
- jurisdictional variants,
- sector-specific interpretations.

Extensions must:
- not redefine CDI meaning,
- not contradict existing mappings without justification,
- be clearly identified as extensions or variants.

---

## 11. Transparency and Accessibility

CMPs shall be:
- documented in machine-readable and human-readable form,
- publicly discoverable where possible,
- accompanied by metadata describing provenance and scope.

Transparency supports ecosystem trust and reduces fragmentation.

---

## 12. Governance and Change Control

Changes to CMPs require:
- documented rationale,
- clear version increments,
- traceable change history.

CMP governance must align with the design principles of CERM and CDI.

---

## 13. Summary

Canonical Mapping Packs provide a **disciplined, transparent mechanism** for translating stable disclosure intent into evolving framework requirements.

By making interpretation explicit while preserving standards authority, CMPs enable scalable, auditable, and future-proof sustainability reporting without creating shadow standards or compliance engines.
