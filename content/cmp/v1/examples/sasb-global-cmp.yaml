    intended_use: >
      Cross-framework interpretation of SASB Standards mapped to
      Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1). Non-authoritative and
      infrastructure-oriented.

  interpretation_principles:
    - CDI remains semantically independent of SASB.
    - SASB defines industry-specific accounting metrics.
    - Financial materiality is framework-specific.
    - Industry specificity does not introduce new CDI domains.
    - No compliance assertion is made.
