### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Workforce disclosures are descriptive and operational.
- No assessment of fairness, adequacy, or effectiveness is performed.

---

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

*(This CMP provides intent-level coverage mapping only.  
Framework-specific metrics, definitions, and thresholds vary.)*

---

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require disclosure of workforce size and movement.
- Health and safety disclosures are widely standardised but calculated differently.
- Training disclosures vary in scope and granularity.
- Collective bargaining disclosures are often jurisdiction-specific.
- Governance disclosures are largely narrative.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- Value-chain workforce disclosures are excluded.
- Human rights and DEI outcomes are excluded.
- Pay equity and living wage disclosures are excluded.
- Jurisdiction-specific labour law requirements are not addressed.
- Interpretations are non-authoritative.
