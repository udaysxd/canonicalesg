## Scope Declaration

This CMP documents illustrative interpretations of **pollution-related disclosure intents**.

### Topic Scope
- Non-greenhouse-gas air emissions
- Water pollution
- Soil and land contamination
- Pollution management and monitoring
- Accidental and routine pollution releases

This CMP is illustrative and non-authoritative.

### Disclosure Intents Covered

- CDI-POLL-01 — Non-greenhouse gas air pollutant emissions  
- CDI-POLL-02 — Air pollutant emissions by category  
- CDI-POLL-03 — Pollutants discharged to water  
- CDI-POLL-04 — Water pollutant discharge by category  
- CDI-POLL-05 — Pollutants released to soil or land  
- CDI-POLL-06 — Contamination of land from operational activities  
- CDI-POLL-07 — Operational sources of pollution  
- CDI-POLL-08 — Pollution associated with production or processing activities  
- CDI-POLL-09 — Existence of pollution-related policies or controls  
- CDI-POLL-10 — Pollution monitoring and measurement processes  
- CDI-POLL-11 — Use of pollution control or abatement technologies  
- CDI-POLL-12 — Accidental pollution releases or spills  
- CDI-POLL-13 — Response to pollution incidents  
- CDI-POLL-14 — Changes in pollution emissions or releases  
- CDI-POLL-15 — Changes in pollution sources or processes  
- CDI-POLL-16 — Changes in pollution management practices  

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E2 (Pollution)
- GRI 306 / 307 (Pollution-related disclosures)
- SASB industry-specific pollution metrics

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Pollution disclosures are separated from regulatory compliance.
- No toxicity, severity, or impact scoring is implied.

Disclose emissions of air pollutants other than greenhouse gases.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Air emissions (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 305 / 306 (Contextual)  
**SASB**: Industry air pollutant metrics (Contextual)

---

### CDI-POLL-03 — Pollutants discharged to water

**Intent**  
Disclose pollutants discharged to water bodies or systems.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Water pollution (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Full)

---

### CDI-POLL-05 — Pollutants released to soil or land

**Intent**  
Disclose releases of pollutants to soil or land.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Soil contamination (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 / 307 (Contextual)  
**SASB**: Land contamination metrics (Contextual)

---

### CDI-POLL-09 — Existence of pollution-related policies or controls

**Intent**  
Disclose organisational policies or controls addressing pollution.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Policies and controls (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 103 / 307 (Contextual)  
**SASB**: Environmental management disclosures (Contextual)

---

### CDI-POLL-12 — Accidental pollution releases or spills

**Intent**  
Disclose accidental or unplanned pollution releases or spills.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Incidents and spills (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 / 307 (Contextual)  
**SASB**: Incident reporting (Contextual)

---

### CDI-POLL-14 — Changes in pollution emissions or releases

**Intent**  
Disclose changes in pollution emissions or releases over time.

**ESRS**: ESRS E2 — Changes over time (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**SASB**: Trend disclosures (Contextual)

---

## Cross-Framework Observations

- Pollution disclosures often mix compliance and performance; CMP enforces separation.
- Quantitative disclosure expectations vary widely by jurisdiction.
- Incident reporting is typically narrative-driven.
- Air, water, and soil pollution are treated inconsistently across frameworks.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- No regulatory thresholds or permit limits included.
- No toxicity or health impact assessment.
- Sector-specific pollutant lists excluded.
- Interpretations are illustrative and non-authoritative.
