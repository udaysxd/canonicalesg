EU Taxonomy Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack
Complete Regulatory Classification Modelling

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the jurisdiction-level interpretation of the European Union Taxonomy Regulation against CDI v1.

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Interprets EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852)

Covers Climate & Environmental Delegated Acts

Integrates Economic, Environmental, and Governance CDIs

Does not alter CDI semantic meaning

Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

1. Regulatory Architecture Covered

This CMP reflects:

EU Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852

Climate Delegated Act

Environmental Delegated Act

Article 8 disclosure requirements

Environmental Objectives:

Climate Change Mitigation

Climate Change Adaptation

Sustainable Use of Water

Transition to Circular Economy

Pollution Prevention and Control

Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity

2. Structural Position in Canonical ESG

Layer 1 — CDI Semantic Model
Layer 2 — Cross-Framework CMP
Layer 3 — Jurisdiction CMP (This file)

This CMP models:

Economic activity classification

Substantial contribution logic

DNSH cross-domain checks

Minimum safeguards

Financial alignment metrics

3. Core Regulatory Constructs
3.1 Taxonomy-Eligible Activities

Economic activities defined in Delegated Acts.

Mapped to:

CDI-ECON activity CDIs

Relevant Environmental CDIs

3.2 Taxonomy-Aligned Activities

Activities must:

Make substantial contribution

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)

Comply with Minimum Safeguards

3.3 Substantial Contribution

Each objective defines Technical Screening Criteria (TSC).

Mapped to:

Climate CDIs

Water CDIs

Biodiversity CDIs

Pollution CDIs

Materials CDIs

3.4 Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)

Cross-objective protection logic.

DNSH cross-links:

Objective	DNSH Domains
Climate	Pollution, Biodiversity, Water
Water	Pollution, Biodiversity
Circular Economy	Pollution, Climate
Biodiversity	Climate, Water

DNSH is structurally mapped through cross-domain CDI relationships.

3.5 Minimum Safeguards

Includes:

OECD Guidelines

UN Guiding Principles

Human Rights compliance

Mapped to:

Workforce CDIs

Value Chain Workers CDIs

Governance CDIs

3.6 Financial Disclosure Requirements (Article 8)

Entities must disclose:

% Taxonomy-aligned Turnover

% Taxonomy-aligned CapEx

% Taxonomy-aligned OpEx

Mapped to:

CDI-ECON Revenue CDIs

CDI-ECON Capital Allocation CDIs

CDI-ECON Operational Expenditure CDIs

4. Domain Integration
Environmental CDIs

Climate
Water
Pollution
Biodiversity
Materials

All six environmental objectives fully covered.

Economic CDIs

Revenue composition
Capital allocation
Operational investment
Economic activity classification

Governance CDIs

Minimum safeguards
Policy architecture
Due diligence
Oversight

5. Structural Completeness Declaration

This CMP provides:

✔ Full coverage of all 6 EU Environmental Objectives
✔ Substantial Contribution modelling
✔ DNSH cross-domain modelling
✔ Minimum Safeguards integration
✔ Article 8 financial alignment modelling
✔ Integration across Environmental + Economic + Governance domains

No CDI v1 domain is excluded.

6. Limitations

Technical Screening Criteria thresholds are not embedded numerically.

Sectoral granularity is not hard-coded.

No legal interpretation is asserted.

XBRL tagging not modelled.

7. Freeze Declaration

This EU Taxonomy CMP is declared structurally complete.
