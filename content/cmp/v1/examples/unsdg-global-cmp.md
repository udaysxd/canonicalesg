United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
Global Cross-Framework Canonical Mapping Pack
UNSDG Global CMP — Complete
1. Purpose

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) provides a structured alignment between:

United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
and
Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1)

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

Does not redefine CDI semantics

Does not convert SDGs into reporting obligations

Does not imply performance, impact, or contribution claims

Provides interpretive mapping only

2. Nature of SDGs

The UN SDGs (2015–2030 Agenda) are:

Global development goals

Outcome-oriented

Policy-driven

Multi-stakeholder

They are not:

Reporting standards

Structured disclosure frameworks

Audit-based compliance systems

Therefore, this CMP maps goal intent → disclosure semantics, not compliance.

3. Structural Position in Canonical ESG Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through three layers:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model

CDI defines stable disclosure meaning.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

This UNSDG CMP aligns SDG goal structure to CDI v1 domains.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Legal interpretations (e.g., EU, future jurisdictional SDG adoption).

4. SDG Domain Alignment

The 17 SDGs span all CDI domains.

Environmental SDGs
SDG	Theme	CDI Domains
SDG 6	Clean Water	Water
SDG 7	Affordable Energy	Energy
SDG 12	Responsible Consumption	Materials, Waste
SDG 13	Climate Action	Climate
SDG 14	Life Below Water	Water (marine context)
SDG 15	Life on Land	Biodiversity
Social SDGs
SDG	Theme	CDI Domains
SDG 1	No Poverty	Economic, Workforce, Communities
SDG 2	Zero Hunger	Communities, Value Chain
SDG 3	Good Health	Workforce, Consumers
SDG 4	Education	Workforce
SDG 5	Gender Equality	Workforce
SDG 8	Decent Work	Workforce, Economic
SDG 10	Reduced Inequalities	Workforce, Communities
SDG 11	Sustainable Cities	Communities
SDG 16	Peace & Institutions	Governance
Economic & Systemic SDGs
SDG	Theme	CDI Domains
SDG 8	Economic Growth	Economic
SDG 9	Industry & Innovation	Economic, Materials
SDG 17	Partnerships	Governance, Economic
5. Interpretation Principles

This CMP follows strict architectural neutrality:

SDGs represent global ambitions, not disclosure mechanics.

CDI defines disclosure meaning independently of SDGs.

SDGs do not introduce new semantic categories.

Mapping is contextual, not prescriptive.

No SDG performance validation is implied.

6. Coverage Declaration

This CMP provides structural interpretive coverage for:

All 17 SDGs

All CDI v1 domains:

Environmental

Social

Governance

Economic

No CDI semantics were altered or expanded.

7. Cross-Framework Observations

SDGs operate at a higher abstraction level than ESRS, ISSB, GRI, SASB, or CDP.

SDG mapping is narrative-aligned rather than metric-prescriptive.

SDG indicators (UN statistical framework) are not embedded into CDI.

SDGs support strategic alignment rather than structured reporting.

8. Limitations

SDGs are not reporting standards.

SDG indicators are not structurally modelled.

No SDG impact measurement logic is included.

No compliance, contribution, or alignment claims are asserted.

9. Structural Completeness Declaration

The UNSDG Global CMP is declared:

Structurally complete
Cross-domain aligned
Semantically neutral
Non-authoritative

It provides interpretive alignment between global development goals and canonical sustainability disclosure semantics.
