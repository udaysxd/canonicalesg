GRI Global Canonical Mapping Pack

CMP — Structurally Complete Global Cross-Framework Layer

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the global cross-framework interpretation layer for sustainability disclosures under the GRI Standards.

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

Interprets GRI Standards against CDI v1 semantic structure

Does not alter CDI meaning

Does not assert compliance with GRI

Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

3. Structural Coverage Declaration

This CMP provides full structural coverage across:

Environmental CDIs

Social CDIs

Governance CDIs

Economic CDIs

No CDI domain is excluded.

4. Cross-Framework Position

GRI represents an impact-focused global sustainability reporting architecture.

GRI:

Is voluntary

Emphasises impact materiality

Does not require financial materiality alignment

Does not impose jurisdictional enforcement

CDI remains neutral.

GRI interpretation is implemented via this CMP only.

6. Interpretation Principles

CDI defines semantic meaning only.

GRI defines disclosure expectations.

This CMP does not assert GRI compliance.

GRI’s impact materiality model is not embedded into CDI.

Mapping reflects structural alignment only.

7. Limitations

Sector Standards are not separately mapped.

GRI topic-specific indicators are abstracted to semantic CDI level.

Regulatory adoption by jurisdictions is not modelled here.

Compliance validation is outside scope.
