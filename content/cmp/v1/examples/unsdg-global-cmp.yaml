    intended_use: >
      Global cross-framework interpretive mapping aligning UN SDG goal
      structure to Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1). This CMP does
      not convert SDGs into disclosure obligations.

  interpretation_principles:
    - SDGs represent outcome-oriented global goals, not reporting standards.
    - CDI defines disclosure meaning; SDGs define global ambition.
    - Mapping is directional and interpretive.
    - No compliance or performance claim is implied.
    - SDGs do not introduce new CDI semantics.

  cross_framework_observations:
    - SDGs define outcome ambitions rather than disclosure requirements.
    - SDG mapping is inherently high-level.
    - SDGs span environmental, social, governance, and economic dimensions.
    - SDG alignment is narrative rather than metric-prescriptive.

  limitations:
    - SDGs are not reporting standards.
    - Mapping does not imply SDG contribution measurement.
    - SDG indicators are not structurally embedded in CDI.
    - No performance or impact claims are made.

      summary:
        - Full 17 SDG coverage across CDI domains
        - Cross-domain interpretive mapping
        - No semantic expansion of CDI
