European Union Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack
CMP v0.1 — Canonical Reference Jurisdiction

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the jurisdiction-level interpretation layer for sustainability disclosures under the European Union regulatory framework.

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Interprets EU legal architecture against CDI v1 semantic structure

Does not alter CDI meaning

Does not assert legal compliance

Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

Is designated as the Canonical Reference Jurisdiction (CRJ) for Canonical ESG

1. CMP Metadata

CMP Name: European Union Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack
CMP ID: eu-cmp
CMP Version: v0.1
Status: Frozen — Canonical Reference Jurisdiction
Publication Date: 2026-02-03
Maintainer: Canonical ESG
License: CC BY 4.0
CDI Version Referenced: CDI v1
CMP Type: Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction: European Union
Legal Status: Mandatory (CSRD)

2. Legal Architecture Covered

This CMP reflects the structure and disclosure architecture of:

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)

European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)

Including:

ESRS 1 – General Requirements

ESRS 2 – General Disclosures

ESRS E1–E5 (Environmental Standards)

ESRS S1–S4 (Social Standards)

ESRS G1 (Governance Standard)

Sector-specific ESRS standards are excluded from this version.

3. Position Within Canonical ESG Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through three layers:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model

CDI defines stable disclosure meaning independent of framework or law.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

Topic CMPs interpret CDI across voluntary and global frameworks.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

This EU CMP aligns CDI to binding EU regulatory requirements.

This CMP does not redefine CDI semantics.
It documents how EU law requires disclosure of those semantics.

4. Structural Completeness Declaration

This CMP provides full structural coverage of:

ESRS cross-cutting disclosures (ESRS 1 & 2)

ESRS topical standards (E1–E5, S1–S4, G1)

All CDI v1 domains

No CDI domain is excluded at jurisdiction layer.

4A. Canonical Reference Jurisdiction Status

The European Union sustainability reporting framework (CSRD and ESRS) is designated as the Canonical Reference Jurisdiction (CRJ) for Canonical ESG.

This designation confirms that:

CDI v1 fully represents ESRS disclosure semantics.

CERM v1.1 fully supports modelling of ESRS disclosures, including value chain scope, assurance, geospatial context, and digital tagging.

This CMP provides complete structural coverage of ESRS cross-cutting and topical standards.

No additional canonical element types are required to model EU disclosures.

Status: Canonical Reference Jurisdiction
Effective Date: 2026-02-03

5. ESRS Cross-Cutting Architecture Mapping

The following ESRS cross-cutting components are structurally mapped:

Governance (GOV)

GOV-1 — Governance bodies and sustainability oversight

GOV-2 — Management roles and responsibilities

Mapped to Governance CDIs.

Strategy and Business Model (SBM)

SBM-1 — Strategy and business model integration

SBM-2 — Impacts, risks, and opportunities

SBM-3 — Interaction of material IROs with strategy

Mapped across Governance and domain-specific CDIs.

Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IRO)

IRO-1 — Description of double materiality assessment process

IRO-2 — Sustainability matters identified as material

IRO-3 — Interaction with financial position and performance

Mapped across environmental and social CDIs.

Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR)

MDR-P — Policies

MDR-A — Actions and resources

MDR-T — Targets

MDR-M — Metrics

Mapped structurally across all CDI domains.

Mapping is structural and semantic in nature and does not represent legal paragraph-level equivalence or compliance assertion.

6. ESRS Topical Standards — Domain Hooks

This CMP includes structural mapping hooks for:

Environmental Domains
ESRS E1 — Climate Change

Mapped to Climate CDIs (CDI-CLIM-01 → CDI-CLIM-32)

ESRS E2 — Pollution

Mapped to Pollution CDIs (CDI-POLL-01 → CDI-POLL-16)

ESRS E3 — Water and Marine Resources

Mapped to Water CDIs

ESRS E4 — Biodiversity and Ecosystems

Mapped to Biodiversity CDIs (CDI-BIOD-01 → CDI-BIOD-18)

ESRS E5 — Resource Use and Circular Economy

Mapped to Materials & Circularity CDIs (CDI-MATR-01 → CDI-MATR-20)
and Waste CDIs

Social Domains
ESRS S1 — Own Workforce

Mapped to Workforce CDIs (CDI-WORK-01 → CDI-WORK-22)

ESRS S2 — Workers in the Value Chain

Mapped to Value Chain Workers CDIs

ESRS S3 — Affected Communities

Mapped to Affected Communities CDIs

ESRS S4 — Consumers and End-Users

Mapped to Consumers & End-Users CDIs

Governance Domain
ESRS G1 — Business Conduct

Mapped to Governance CDIs (CDI-GOVR series)

7. Regulatory Characteristics (Jurisdiction-Specific)
7.1 Double Materiality

EU reporting requires:

Impact materiality

Financial materiality

Materiality logic is regulatory and external to CDI semantics.

7.2 Value Chain Scope

EU reporting may extend beyond operational boundaries into:

Upstream activities

Downstream activities

CERM boundaries remain neutral.
Jurisdiction CMP specifies regulatory extension.

7.3 Assurance

CSRD requires:

Limited assurance initially

Potential progression to reasonable assurance

Assurance requirements are regulatory, not semantic.

7.4 Phased Application

Application depends on:

Entity size

Listing status

Reporting year

Phasing logic is outside CDI.

7.5 Digital Tagging

EU requires structured digital tagging under ESEF/XBRL.

Digital tagging is modelled through CERM MetricIdentifier elements but does not alter CDI semantics.

7A. CERM Structural Alignment

EU reporting architecture is fully representable using CERM v1.1 elements, including:

Entity

Boundary

GeospatialBoundary

Metric and MetricIdentifier

TimePeriod

Methodology

Assertion

Assurance

Target and Trajectory

No additional canonical element types are required for EU structural modelling.

8. Domain Coverage (CDI v1 Complete)

This CMP exercises and structurally maps all CDI v1 domains without exclusion.

Environmental:

Climate

Energy

Water

Waste

Pollution

Biodiversity

Materials & Circularity

Social:

Workforce

Value Chain Workers

Affected Communities

Consumers & End-Users

Governance:

Governance

No CDI domain is excluded at jurisdiction layer.

9. Interpretation Principles

CDI defines semantic meaning only.

EU law defines disclosure obligation.

This CMP does not assert legal compliance.

Mapping reflects ESRS structural architecture.

Double materiality remains jurisdiction-specific.

Regulatory extensions do not alter CDI meaning.

EU regulatory obligations are external constructs applied at CMP layer only and do not modify CDI semantic structure.

No legal interpretation is provided.

10. Cross-Domain Observations

ESRS integrates governance across all domains.

Narrative disclosure requirements are extensive.

Value chain reporting is structurally broader than many global standards.

ESRS tightly integrates policy, action, target, and metric disclosures.

Digital tagging introduces structured reporting obligations not present in CDI.

11. Limitations

Sector-specific ESRS standards are excluded.

EU Taxonomy alignment disclosures are excluded.

Digital tagging technical schemas are not represented.

Legal compliance determinations are outside scope.

Regulatory interpretation is not provided.
