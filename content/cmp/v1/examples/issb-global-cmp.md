# ISSB Global Baseline Canonical Mapping Pack
CMP — Structurally Complete Global Cross-Framework Layer

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the global baseline interpretation layer for sustainability disclosures under the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) framework.

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping  
Interprets IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards against CDI v1 semantic structure  
Does not alter CDI meaning  
Does not assert regulatory compliance  
Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

## 1. CMP Metadata

CMP Name: ISSB Global Baseline Canonical Mapping Pack  
CMP ID: issb-global-cmp  
Status: Structurally Complete Global Baseline  
Maintainer: Canonical ESG  
License: CC BY 4.0  
CDI Version Referenced: CDI v1  
CMP Type: Topic (Global Cross-Framework)  
Framework Authority: IFRS Foundation / ISSB  

---

## 2. Standards Covered

This CMP reflects the structure and disclosure architecture of:

IFRS S1 — General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information  
IFRS S2 — Climate-related Disclosures  

Only currently issued standards are included.

---

## 3. Position Within Canonical ESG Architecture

Layer 1 — Semantic Model  
CDI defines stable disclosure meaning independent of framework or law.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping  
This ISSB CMP interprets CDI semantics against IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping  
Jurisdiction CMPs (e.g., UK, Singapore, Canada) may adopt ISSB and layer regulatory obligations on top.

This CMP does not redefine CDI semantics.  
It documents how ISSB requires disclosure of those semantics.

---

## 4. Structural Completeness Declaration

This CMP provides structural coverage of:

IFRS S1 architecture (governance, strategy, risk management, metrics & targets)  
IFRS S2 climate architecture  
All climate-related CDI v1 domains  
Governance CDIs  
Financial-risk connected sustainability semantics  

ISSB currently does not include biodiversity, water, social, or pollution standalone standards.  
However, CDI domains remain available for future ISSB expansion.

---

## 5. IFRS S1 Architecture Mapping

IFRS S1 requires disclosure across four pillars:

Governance  
Strategy  
Risk Management  
Metrics & Targets  

Mapped structurally to:

Governance CDIs  
Climate CDIs  
Methodology CDIs  
Target and Trajectory CDIs  

---

## 6. IFRS S2 — Climate Architecture Mapping

IFRS S2 aligns with TCFD architecture and includes:

Governance  
Strategy  
Risk Management  
Metrics and Targets  
Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions  
Transition planning  
Scenario analysis  
Climate resilience  

Mapped to Climate CDIs (CDI-CLIM-01 → CDI-CLIM-32)

---

## 7. Regulatory Characteristics (Framework-Level)

ISSB:

Is not jurisdiction-specific  
Does not mandate double materiality  
Uses financial materiality focus  
Requires industry-based metrics where applicable  
Aligns with TCFD structure  

Materiality determination is external to CDI.

---

## 8. Domain Coverage (CDI v1)

This CMP structurally covers:

Environmental:
Climate
Energy (via climate linkage)

Governance:
Governance

Future ISSB standards may extend to:
Biodiversity
Human Capital
Other sustainability topics

---

## 9. Interpretation Principles

CDI defines semantic meaning only.  
ISSB defines disclosure architecture.  
This CMP does not assert compliance.  
Financial materiality focus remains framework-specific.  
No jurisdiction logic is embedded.  
No legal interpretation is provided.

---

## 10. Cross-Domain Observations

ISSB integrates sustainability into financial reporting architecture.  
Climate is currently the only issued topical standard.  
Risk and resilience analysis are structurally central.  
Industry-based metrics may reference SASB lineage.  

---

## 11. Limitations

Only IFRS S1 and S2 are included.  
Industry metric granularity is not enumerated individually.  
Jurisdiction adoption logic is excluded.  
No digital taxonomy (XBRL) modelling included.  
Compliance interpretation is outside scope.

---

## 12. Completion Declaration

This ISSB CMP represents a structurally complete Layer 2 mapping for all currently issued ISSB standards (S1 and S2).

It establishes a global baseline interpretation layer compatible with CDI v1.
