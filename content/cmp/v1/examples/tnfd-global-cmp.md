TNFD Global CMP

Version: complete
Status: Frozen
CDI Version: v1
Publication Date: 2026-02-10
CMP Type: cross_framework
Maintainer: Canonical ESG
License: Canonical ESG Open License

1. Purpose

This CMP provides a structurally complete interpretive mapping between the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Final Recommendations (2023) and Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) under CDI v1.

This CMP is non-authoritative and intended for semantic interoperability across sustainability frameworks.

2. Scope

Topic: Nature-related financial disclosures

Framework Covered:

TNFD Final Recommendations (2023)

CDI Domains Covered:

Climate

Biodiversity

Water

Pollution

Materials

Governance

Value Chain Workers

Economic

Intended Use:

Cross-framework semantic alignment between TNFD disclosures and CDI v1 domains for modelling, reporting interoperability, and jurisdictional reuse.

3. Interpretive Principles

TNFD governance disclosures map to Governance CDIs.

Nature dependencies map primarily to Biodiversity and Water CDIs.

Risk identification integrates with Governance + Economic CDIs.

LEAP does not create new CDIs; it operationalizes existing ones.

Sector guidance is interpreted only where it alters disclosure meaning.

4. Structural Mapping Overview
Governance Pillar

TNFD governance requirements map to:

CDI-GOVR-01 (Board oversight)

CDI-GOVR-02 (Management roles)

CDI-GOVR-05 (Risk oversight architecture)

Strategy Pillar

Maps to:

CDI-BIOD-01–BIOD-06 (Nature dependencies & impacts)

CDI-WATR-01–WATR-05 (Water exposure)

CDI-CLIM-07 (Scenario analysis integration)

CDI-GOVR-08 (Strategy integration)

Risk & Impact Management

Maps to:

CDI-GOVR-09–GOVR-14 (Risk management integration)

CDI-ECON-05–ECON-08 (Financial exposure modelling)

CDI-VCWR-03 (Supply chain exposure)

Metrics & Targets

Maps to:

CDI-BIOD-10–BIOD-18

CDI-WATR-10–WATR-20

CDI-POLL-08–POLL-16

CDI-MATR-07–MATR-20

CDI-CLIM-20–CLIM-32 (where climate-nature overlap exists)

LEAP Methodology

LEAP maps to:

Locate → Biodiversity + Value Chain CDIs

Evaluate → Impact measurement CDIs

Assess → Governance + Economic CDIs

Prepare → Targets + Strategy CDIs

LEAP is interpretive structure, not a separate disclosure layer.

5. Cross-Framework Observations

TNFD and ISSB S1 share governance architecture.

TNFD biodiversity metrics align with ESRS E4.

TNFD water metrics overlap with ESRS E3 and GRI 303.

TNFD financial risk modelling aligns partially with ISSB S1 and S2.

6. Limitations

TNFD sector guidance is interpreted generically.

TNFD does not define numeric thresholds.

This CMP does not prescribe compliance outcomes.
