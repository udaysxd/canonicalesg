# CDP Global Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP — Complete)

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the cross-framework interpretation layer for CDP disclosure questionnaires.

This CMP:

- Operates at Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping
- Interprets CDP questionnaires against CDI v1 semantic structure
- Does not alter CDI meaning
- Does not assert scoring equivalence
- Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

---

## 1. Frameworks Covered

This CMP reflects structural alignment with:

- CDP Climate Change Questionnaire
- CDP Water Security Questionnaire
- CDP Forests Questionnaire
- CDP Supply Chain Module

---

## 2. Structural Completeness Declaration

This CMP provides structural mapping coverage across:

- Climate CDIs
- Energy CDIs
- Water CDIs
- Biodiversity CDIs
- Materials CDIs
- Value Chain Workers CDIs
- Governance CDIs
- Relevant Economic CDIs (e.g. internal carbon pricing)

No CDI v1 domain is excluded where CDP requests structurally aligned information.

---

## 3. CDP Module → CDI Alignment

### Climate Questionnaire

Mapped to:
- Climate governance
- Climate risks & opportunities
- Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions
- Targets & transition plans
- Internal carbon pricing
- Energy consumption
- Scenario analysis

### Water Security

Mapped to:
- Water withdrawal
- Water discharge
- Water risk assessment
- Water targets
- Basin-level context

### Forests

Mapped to:
- Biodiversity-sensitive areas
- Commodity sourcing
- Deforestation exposure
- Supply chain traceability
- Materials sourcing practices

### Supply Chain

Mapped to:
- Value chain worker disclosures
- Scope 3 emissions
- Supplier engagement processes
- Governance oversight

---

## 4. Interpretation Principles

- CDP scoring is not modelled in CDI.
- Questionnaire structure is mapped to semantic intents.
- Narrative responses align with narrative CDIs.
- Quantitative responses align with metric CDIs.
- No compliance or scoring equivalence is asserted.

---

## 5. Limitations

- CDP scoring methodology excluded.
- CDP sector weighting excluded.
- CDP platform logic excluded.
- This mapping reflects disclosure structure only.

---

## 6. Status

Complete global cross-framework mapping for CDP.
