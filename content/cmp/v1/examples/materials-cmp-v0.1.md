# Materials and Circularity Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP v0.1)

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents illustrative interpretations of **materials and circularity-related disclosure intents** defined in Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1).

It is provided as a **non-authoritative reference implementation**.

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E5 (Resource use and circular economy)
- GRI 301–306 (Materials, Waste)
- CDP Materials and Circularity-related disclosures

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Materials and circularity disclosures are operational in scope.
- No validation of circularity performance or benefit is performed.

---

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

*(This CMP provides intent-level coverage mapping only.  
Framework-specific granularity and thresholds vary.)*

---

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require disclosure of material inputs and material use.
- Circularity disclosures are commonly linked to waste reporting.
- Definitions of recycled and secondary materials vary by framework.
- Quantitative disclosures are often required but interpreted differently.
- Circularity performance assessments are framework-specific.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- Product-level circularity claims are excluded.
- Lifecycle assessment disclosures are excluded.
- Value-chain circularity beyond operations is excluded.
- Jurisdictional regulatory requirements are not addressed.
- Interpretations are non-authoritative.
