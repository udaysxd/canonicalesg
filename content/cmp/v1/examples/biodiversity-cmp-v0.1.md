## Scope Declaration

This CMP documents illustrative interpretations of **biodiversity-related disclosure intents**.

### Topic Scope
- Biodiversity-related disclosures
- Organisational interaction with natural systems
- Dependencies on ecosystems and biodiversity

This CMP is illustrative and non-authoritative.

### Disclosure Intents Covered

- CDI-BIOD-01 — Presence of operations in or near natural areas  
- CDI-BIOD-02 — Operational land use footprint  
- CDI-BIOD-03 — Operational activities in biodiversity-sensitive contexts  
- CDI-BIOD-04 — Land use or land transformation activities  
- CDI-BIOD-05 — Resource extraction or harvesting activities  
- CDI-BIOD-06 — Physical disturbance or alteration of natural environments  
- CDI-BIOD-07 — Dependency on ecosystem services  
- CDI-BIOD-08 — Dependency on natural habitats or ecosystems  
- CDI-BIOD-09 — Dependency on biodiversity-related natural resources  
- CDI-BIOD-10 — Existence of biodiversity-related policies or commitments  
- CDI-BIOD-11 — Organisational responsibility for biodiversity management  
- CDI-BIOD-12 — Integration of biodiversity considerations into operational planning  
- CDI-BIOD-13 — Processes for identifying biodiversity interactions  
- CDI-BIOD-14 — Processes for monitoring biodiversity-related interactions  
- CDI-BIOD-15 — Use of external guidance or frameworks for biodiversity assessment  
- CDI-BIOD-16 — Changes in areas of biodiversity interaction  
- CDI-BIOD-17 — Changes in biodiversity-related dependencies  
- CDI-BIOD-18 — Changes in biodiversity management approaches  

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E4 (Biodiversity and Ecosystems)
- GRI 304 (Biodiversity)
- CDP Forests and Biodiversity-related disclosures

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Biodiversity is treated as organisational interaction and dependency.
- No ecological impact assessment, risk scoring, or performance claims are inferred.

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

### CDI-BIOD-01 — Presence of operations in or near natural areas

**Intent**  
Disclose whether organisational operations are located in or near natural or semi-natural areas.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Location of activities (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Location in natural areas (Contextual)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Does not imply protected status or ecological sensitivity classification.

---

### CDI-BIOD-02 — Operational land use footprint

**Intent**  
Disclose the extent or description of land used for organisational operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Land use (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304-1 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Land footprint (Partial)

---

### CDI-BIOD-03 — Operational activities in biodiversity-sensitive contexts

**Intent**  
Disclose whether operations occur in contexts considered biodiversity-sensitive.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Sensitive areas (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304-2 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Sensitive ecosystem presence (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-04 — Land use or land transformation activities

**Intent**  
Disclose land use or land conversion activities associated with operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Land conversion (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304-2 (Partial)  
**CDP**: Land-use change (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-05 — Resource extraction or harvesting activities

**Intent**  
Disclose extraction or harvesting of biological or natural resources.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Resource use (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Resource dependency (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-07 — Dependency on ecosystem services

**Intent**  
Disclose dependency on ecosystem services supporting operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Ecosystem dependencies (Contextual)  
**GRI**: GRI 304 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Ecosystem services dependency (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-10 — Existence of biodiversity-related policies or commitments

**Intent**  
Disclose the existence of biodiversity-related organisational policies.

**GRI**: GRI 304 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Biodiversity policies (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-13 — Processes for identifying biodiversity interactions

**Intent**  
Disclose processes used to identify interactions between operations and biodiversity.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Due diligence processes (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Identification processes (Contextual)

---

### CDI-BIOD-16 — Changes in areas of biodiversity interaction

**Intent**  
Disclose changes in the nature or location of biodiversity interactions over time.

**ESRS**: ESRS E4 — Changes over time (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 304 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Changes in exposure (Contextual)

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require contextual biodiversity disclosure.
- Metric requirements vary significantly.
- Impact severity and significance are framework-specific.
- CMP enforces separation between interaction description and ecological judgement.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- No species-level or habitat condition metrics.
- No assessment of biodiversity impact or loss.
- No risk quantification or TNFD-style analysis.
- Sector-specific biodiversity disclosures excluded.
