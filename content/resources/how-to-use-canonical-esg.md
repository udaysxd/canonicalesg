# How to Use Canonical ESG in Practice

## Purpose

This guide explains how Canonical ESG can be used in real-world sustainability reporting workflows.

It is intended to help practitioners understand:
- where Canonical ESG fits,
- how it complements existing standards and processes,
- how it can be applied without changing reporting obligations.

This guide is illustrative and non-prescriptive.

## Canonical ESG in a Reporting Workflow

Canonical ESG is designed to sit *between* data collection and reporting outputs.

A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Organisations collect sustainability data.
2. Data is modelled using internal systems or tools.
3. Disclosures are interpreted according to reporting frameworks.
4. Reports are produced for regulators, stakeholders, or platforms.

Canonical ESG supports steps 2 and 3 by making structure, meaning, and interpretation explicit.

---

## Step 1: Model Sustainability Data Once (CERM)

In practice, organisations already model sustainability data internally.

Canonical ESG does not replace existing systems.

Instead, CERM can be used as:
- a reference for structuring internal data models,
- a common vocabulary across teams or tools,
- a bridge between disparate data sources.

Using CERM helps ensure that data is defined consistently before it is interpreted for reporting.

---

## Step 2: Identify Disclosure Meaning (CDI)

Reporting frameworks often ask similar questions in different ways.

Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) help clarify:
- what information a disclosure is communicating,
- independent of where or how it will be reported.

In practice, CDIs can be used to:
- label internal data with disclosure meaning,
- align teams on what a disclosure represents,
- reduce ambiguity when preparing multi-framework reports.

CDIs do not determine whether a disclosure is required or material.

---

## Step 3: Document Framework Interpretation (CMP)

Interpretation of reporting frameworks is unavoidable.

Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) provide a way to:
- document how disclosure intents map to specific frameworks,
- make assumptions and judgement explicit,
- reuse interpretation decisions across reports or clients.

In practice, CMPs can be:
- referenced by consultants and auditors,
- implemented by software systems,
- adapted for jurisdictional or sector-specific needs.

CMPs do not assert compliance or authority.

---

## Step 4: Produce Reporting Outputs

Once data, meaning, and interpretation are separated:
- reports can be generated more consistently,
- disclosures can be reused across frameworks,
- changes to frameworks can be managed more systematically.

Canonical ESG does not prescribe reporting formats or outputs.

---

## Common Use Cases

Canonical ESG can be applied in various contexts, including:

- multi-framework reporting (e.g. ESRS + GRI + CDP),
- internal sustainability data governance,
- audit preparation and review,
- software platform development,
- assurance and traceability analysis.

Different organisations may use different components depending on their needs.

---

## What Canonical ESG Does Not Require

Using Canonical ESG does not require:
- adopting new reporting frameworks,
- changing regulatory obligations,
- restructuring existing tools,
- centralising decision-making.

It can be applied incrementally.

---

## Using Canonical ESG Incrementally

Organisations may start by:
- using CDIs to clarify disclosure meaning,
- referencing CMPs to document interpretation,
- aligning internal data structures with CERM over time.

There is no required adoption sequence.

---

## Relationship to Professional Judgement

Canonical ESG is not a substitute for professional judgement.

Materiality, applicability, and compliance decisions remain the responsibility of:
- reporting entities,
- consultants,
- auditors.

Canonical ESG exists to support clarity, not to determine outcomes.

---

## Summary

Canonical ESG provides a practical way to:
- separate data, meaning, and interpretation,
- reduce duplication and ambiguity,
- improve reuse and transparency.

It can be used alongside existing standards and processes without replacing them.

Its value increases as reporting complexity grows.
