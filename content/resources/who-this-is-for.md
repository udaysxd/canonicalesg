# Who Canonical ESG is for

Canonical ESG is designed as shared infrastructure for sustainability reporting ecosystems.

It is intentionally neutral, non-authoritative, and reusable across organisations, frameworks, and tools.

This page describes who Canonical ESG is intended to support — and what it is not intended to replace.

---

## Auditors and Assurance Providers

Canonical ESG supports auditors and assurance providers by improving transparency and traceability in sustainability disclosures.

It enables:
- clearer separation between data, disclosure meaning, and interpretation,
- explicit documentation of interpretation assumptions,
- improved traceability from reported figures back to source data,
- more consistent review across reporting frameworks.

Canonical ESG does not:
- define audit procedures,
- replace professional judgement,
- assert compliance with assurance standards.

It provides a structured reference that can make assurance work more reviewable and explainable without prescribing outcomes.

## Consultants and Advisors

Canonical ESG supports consultants and advisors who assist organisations with sustainability reporting, framework alignment, and transformation.

It enables:
- reuse of disclosure meaning across multiple frameworks,
- clearer articulation of interpretation choices,
- reduced duplication when supporting multi-framework reporting,
- improved consistency across client engagements.

Canonical ESG does not:
- replace advisory services,
- provide prescriptive templates,
- define "correct" interpretations.

It provides a neutral structure that consultants can apply, adapt, and extend while retaining responsibility for judgement and advice.

## Software and Tool Builders

Canonical ESG supports software teams building sustainability platforms, internal reporting tools, and validation workflows.

It enables:
- separation of data modelling from reporting logic,
- machine-readable disclosure semantics,
- explicit mapping of meaning to framework requirements,
- reduced hard-coded interpretation logic.

Canonical ESG does not:
- mandate technical architectures,
- prescribe APIs or storage models,
- replace domain expertise.

It provides a reference layer that tools can implement without embedding opaque assumptions.

## Standards Observers and Researchers

Canonical ESG may be useful to:
- standards observers,
- policy researchers,
- interoperability initiatives.

It offers a way to examine how disclosure meaning and interpretation vary across frameworks without asserting authority or proposing unification.

---

## Who Canonical ESG is not for

Canonical ESG is not intended to:
- replace sustainability reporting frameworks,
- act as a regulatory standard,
- certify compliance,
- centralise authority over disclosures.

Organisations remain responsible for determining applicability, materiality, and compliance with relevant requirements.

## A shared foundation, not a single answer

Canonical ESG exists to make structure, meaning, and interpretation visible.

Its value lies in enabling clearer collaboration across roles — not in defining a single "correct" way to report.

It is infrastructure for an ecosystem, not a product or mandate.
