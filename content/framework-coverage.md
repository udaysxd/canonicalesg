# Framework Coverage

Canonical ESG maintains structural mappings across global sustainability standards and regulatory regimes.

Coverage reflects semantic and structural modelling completeness, not legal endorsement.

## Work In Progress

Canonical ESG is actively developing structural modelling for:

- UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR)
- SEC Climate-related Disclosures
- TCFD legacy structural alignment
- Country-specific taxonomy regimes (e.g., ASEAN, China)

Future expansions may include:

- Integrated reporting frameworks
- National sustainability taxonomies
- Financial institution–specific sustainability regimes

## Coverage Principles

Coverage status reflects:

- Full semantic alignment with CDI v1
- Cross-framework interpretive modelling
- Structural validation against Canonical ESG schemas

Canonical ESG does not assert regulatory compliance.
