# Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) define the **semantic meaning of sustainability disclosures**, independent of reporting frameworks, regulations, or presentation formats.

CDIs answer the question:

> *What is the organisation disclosing?*

They do **not** determine:
- whether a disclosure is required,
- how it should be calculated,
- whether it is material,
- or whether it complies with any standard.

CDIs are consumed by Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) to document how disclosure meaning is interpreted by specific reporting frameworks.

## Purpose of CDI

CDIs exist to:

- provide a stable, framework-agnostic vocabulary for disclosure meaning,
- separate disclosure semantics from data modelling (CERM),
- separate disclosure semantics from framework interpretation (CMP),
- enable reuse of disclosure meaning across multiple reporting standards,
- support traceability and auditability of reported information.

CDIs are **non-authoritative** and **non-prescriptive**.

---

## CDI Domains

CDIs are organised by sustainability topic domain.  
Each domain has its own stable taxonomy.

---

## Climate Disclosure Intents

Climate Disclosure Intents define the semantic meaning of commonly requested **climate-related disclosures**, including:

- governance and strategy,
- risks and opportunities,
- policies and commitments,
- targets and transition planning,
- greenhouse gas emissions,
- energy and mitigation actions,
- performance and progress,
- methodology and assumptions.

Climate CDIs are independent of:
- any specific reporting framework,
- any climate target or pathway,
- any materiality assessment.

## Energy Disclosure Intents

Energy Disclosure Intents define the semantic meaning of **energy-related disclosures**, including:

- energy consumption,
- energy sources and mix,
- energy procurement and generation,
- energy intensity and efficiency,
- energy boundaries and methodologies.

Energy CDIs are:
- distinct from greenhouse gas accounting,
- independent of emissions factors,
- non-authoritative,
- designed for reuse across reporting frameworks and energy standards.

The Energy CDI taxonomy is frozen as **CDI v1**.

## Relationship to Other Canonical ESG Layers

- **CERM** defines *how sustainability data is structured*
- **CDI** defines *what a disclosure means*
- **CMP** documents *how disclosure meaning maps to specific frameworks*

These layers are intentionally separated and must not be collapsed.

---

## Status and Versioning

- Climate CDI taxonomy: **CDI v1 (frozen)**
- Energy CDI taxonomy: **CDI v1 (frozen)**

Future domains and extensions will be introduced only through new major versions.

---

## Non-Authority Statement

CDIs:
- do not define reporting obligations,
- do not assert compliance,
- do not provide regulatory or assurance guidance,
- are not endorsed by any standards-setting body.

All use of CDIs requires professional judgement.
