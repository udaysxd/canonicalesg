CDI Taxonomy Overview

1. Purpose

This document provides an overview of the Canonical Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy structure for CDI v1.

The CDI taxonomy defines stable, framework-independent disclosure intents that capture the semantic meaning of commonly requested sustainability information across global reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy is designed to support full structural coverage of major sustainability architectures including:

• ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards)
• ISSB / IFRS Sustainability Standards
• GRI Standards (including Economic, Environmental and Social)
• Other voluntary and regulatory frameworks

Each domain within the CDI taxonomy maintains its own dedicated taxonomy document. This separation enables:

• independent domain evolution,
• clear domain boundaries,
• extensibility for new sustainability topics,
• full-spectrum sustainability modelling without semantic drift.

2. Taxonomy Principles

The CDI taxonomy follows these cross-domain principles.

2.1 Independence from Reporting Standards

• CDIs are independent of any reporting standard or framework.
• CDIs do not prescribe disclosure obligations.
• CDIs do not assert completeness or compliance.
• CDIs do not encode regulatory logic.
• Framework-specific interpretations are handled exclusively through Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

2.2 Semantic Stability

• Each CDI represents a single semantic concept.
• CDI identifiers are stable across versions.
• Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.
• Extensions do not alter the semantic meaning of existing CDIs.
• Structural expansion does not introduce framework bias.

2.3 Structural Consistency

Each disclosure intent:

• has a unique identifier,
• represents a single semantic concept,
• may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
• may reference one or more canonical data elements,
• remains independent of jurisdiction or regulatory interpretation.

2.4 Full-Spectrum Sustainability Coverage

The taxonomy is designed to cover:

• Environmental sustainability
• Social sustainability
• Governance architecture
• Economic sustainability impacts and performance

This ensures structural alignment with global sustainability frameworks while preserving semantic neutrality.

3. Domain Taxonomies

The CDI v1 taxonomy is structured across four high-level sustainability dimensions:

I. Environmental Domains

Climate Taxonomy

Governance, strategy, risks, targets, greenhouse gas emissions, energy interactions, transition planning, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/climate

Energy Taxonomy

Energy consumption, sourcing, procurement, intensity, efficiency initiatives, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/energy

Water Taxonomy

Water withdrawal, consumption, discharge, sourcing, reuse, water context, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/water

Waste Taxonomy

Operational waste generation, classification, treatment pathways, recovery, disposal, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/waste

Pollution Taxonomy

Non-greenhouse gas air emissions, water pollutants, soil contamination, operational sources, monitoring processes, and incident handling.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/pollution

Biodiversity Taxonomy

Organisational interaction with natural areas, land use, ecosystem dependencies, biodiversity management processes, and change over time.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/biodiversity

Materials and Circularity Taxonomy

Material inputs, throughput, recycled and secondary materials, efficiency, recovery practices, and materials governance.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/materials

---

II. Social Domains

Workforce Taxonomy

Organisation’s own workforce composition, employment structure, training, health and safety, worker representation, governance, and reporting methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/workforce

Value Chain Workers Taxonomy

Workers in upstream and downstream value chains, including employment conditions, labour practices, health and safety, and management processes.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/value-chain-workers

Affected Communities Taxonomy

Communities impacted by organisational activities, including engagement processes, impact identification, and grievance mechanisms.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/affected-communities

Consumers and End-Users Taxonomy

Impacts on consumers or end-users, including product safety, information transparency, data protection, accessibility, and complaint mechanisms.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/consumers

---

III. Governance Domain

Governance Taxonomy

Governance oversight, roles and responsibilities, governance processes, policy architecture, ethics structures, internal controls, transparency mechanisms, and reporting scope.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/governance

---

IV. Economic Domain

Economic Sustainability Taxonomy

Economic performance, value creation and distribution, market presence, indirect economic impacts, procurement practices, anti-competitive behaviour, public policy contributions, and economic transparency.

This domain enables structural alignment with:

• GRI 200 series
• ESRS financial interaction disclosures
• ISSB financial materiality architecture

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/economic

---

4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Across all domains, the CDI taxonomy exhibits:

• Framework Independence
• Semantic Precision
• Reusability through CMP
• Version Safety
• Historical Traceability
• Domain Isolation with Cross-Domain Interoperability
• Regulatory Neutrality
• Structural Completeness across ESG + Economic sustainability

CDIs define meaning.
CMPs define interpretation.
Jurisdiction CMPs define regulatory alignment.

---

5. Three-Layer Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through a layered structure:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model

CDI defines stable disclosure meaning independent of frameworks or law.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

Topic CMPs interpret CDIs across global standards such as ESRS, ISSB, and GRI.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Jurisdiction CMPs align CDIs to binding legal and regulatory regimes.

This layered separation ensures long-term interoperability across evolving sustainability architectures.

---

6. Freeze Declaration

The CDI v1 taxonomy establishes a complete semantic foundation for:

• Environmental sustainability
• Social sustainability
• Governance architecture
• Economic sustainability impacts and performance

All domains listed above are frozen under CDI v1.

No further structural domains will be added to CDI v1.

Future structural expansions require a new major version.

---

7. Summary

The CDI v1 taxonomy establishes a full-spectrum sustainability semantic foundation supporting:

• ESRS
• ISSB
• GRI (including Economic standards)
• Global regulatory adoption models

Each domain defines a stable vocabulary for modelling sustainability information independent of frameworks or regulation.

This structure enables:

• single-source semantic modelling,
• multi-framework reuse,
• jurisdictional alignment without semantic drift,
• full ESG + Economic coverage,
• long-term structural stability across regulatory evolution.
