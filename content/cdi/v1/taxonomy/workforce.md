# Workforce Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Workforce Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for workforce-related sustainability disclosures within Canonical ESG.

The Workforce taxonomy captures the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested information related to an organisation’s **own workforce**, independent of value judgements, social outcomes, or regulatory compliance.

The taxonomy:
- is framework-agnostic,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assess fairness, adequacy, or effectiveness,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Workforce CDIs focus on **descriptive facts, counts, rates, and processes** related to employment, health and safety, and workforce management.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Workforce disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Workforce Composition**
2. **Employment Structure**
3. **Workforce Movement**
4. **Training and Skills Development**
5. **Occupational Health and Safety**
6. **Worker Representation**
7. **Governance, Policies, and Methodology**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 3. Workforce Disclosure Intents

### 3.1 Workforce Composition

**CDI-WORK-01**  
**Total workforce size**  
> The total number of individuals employed by the organisation at the reporting date.

**CDI-WORK-02**  
**Workforce by employment type**  
> Workforce disaggregated by employment type (e.g. permanent, temporary, full-time, part-time).

**CDI-WORK-03**  
**Workforce by contract type**  
> Workforce disaggregated by contract type (e.g. employee, contractor), where tracked.

**CDI-WORK-04**  
**Workforce by geography**  
> Workforce disaggregated by geographic region or country.

---

### 3.2 Employment Structure

**CDI-WORK-05**  
**New hires**  
> The number of individuals hired during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-06**  
**Employee departures**  
> The number of individuals leaving employment during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-07**  
**Employee turnover rate**  
> Workforce turnover expressed as a rate over the reporting period.

---

### 3.3 Workforce Movement

**CDI-WORK-08**  
**Changes in workforce size**  
> Changes in total workforce size compared to a prior reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-09**  
**Internal workforce mobility**  
> Movement of employees within the organisation (e.g. role changes, transfers), where tracked.

---

### 3.4 Training and Skills Development

**CDI-WORK-10**  
**Training provided**  
> Training or skills development activities provided to the workforce.

**CDI-WORK-11**  
**Average training hours**  
> Average number of training hours provided per employee during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-12**  
**Training participation rate**  
> Proportion of the workforce participating in training or skills development activities.

---

### 3.5 Occupational Health and Safety

**CDI-WORK-13**  
**Work-related injuries**  
> Number of work-related injuries recorded during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-14**  
**Work-related fatalities**  
> Number of work-related fatalities recorded during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-15**  
**Injury rate**  
> Rate of work-related injuries, calculated using a defined methodology.

**CDI-WORK-16**  
**Occupational illness**  
> Number of work-related illnesses recorded during the reporting period.

**CDI-WORK-17**  
**Health and safety incidents**  
> Recordable occupational health and safety incidents, including near misses where tracked.

---

### 3.6 Worker Representation

**CDI-WORK-18**  
**Collective bargaining coverage**  
> Proportion of the workforce covered by collective bargaining agreements.

---

### 3.7 Governance, Policies, and Methodology

**CDI-WORK-19**  
**Workforce-related policies**  
> The existence and scope of organisational policies related to workforce management.

**CDI-WORK-20**  
**Workforce management responsibility**  
> Assignment of responsibility for workforce management within the organisation.

**CDI-WORK-21**  
**Workforce reporting boundary**  
> Organisational and operational boundaries applied to workforce data.

**CDI-WORK-22**  
**Methodology and assumptions for workforce data**  
> Methodologies, estimation approaches, and assumptions used in workforce reporting.

---

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- Workforce CDIs are **descriptive and operational**, not normative.
- CDIs do not assess fairness, adequacy, or effectiveness of workforce practices.
- Quantitative disclosures represent counts and rates, not thresholds or targets.
- Framework-specific interpretations are handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Workforce Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing workforce-related disclosure meaning across sustainability reporting frameworks.

By focusing on **facts, processes, and measurements** related to an organisation’s own workforce, the taxonomy enables consistent modelling, transparent interpretation, and reuse across frameworks without embedding social judgement or compliance logic.

## Workforce CDI v1 Status

The Workforce Disclosure Intent taxonomy defined in this document is **frozen as CDI v1**.

No new Workforce CDIs will be added to v1.  
Future extensions or refinements will be introduced only through subsequent major versions.

Existing Workforce CDIs will remain stable and referenceable for use in Canonical Mapping Packs and historical disclosures.

*Status: Frozen*  
*Effective version: CDI v1*
