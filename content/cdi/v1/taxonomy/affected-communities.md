# Affected Communities Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Affected Communities Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for sustainability-related disclosures concerning communities that may be affected by an organisation's activities, operations, products, or value chain relationships.

The Affected Communities taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information regarding:

- communities located near operations,
- communities impacted by resource use,
- communities affected by environmental or social externalities,
- communities linked to value chain activities.

The taxonomy:

- is framework-agnostic,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assess social impact magnitude,
- does not determine harm or legality,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Affected Communities CDIs describe interaction, exposure, engagement, and governance, not judgement or impact evaluation.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Affected Communities disclosure intents are grouped into the following domains:

1. **Community Identification and Scope**
2. **Nature of Interaction**
3. **Community Impacts and Risks**
4. **Engagement and Participation**
5. **Grievance and Remediation**
6. **Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups**
7. **Governance and Reporting**

Each disclosure intent:

- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be narrative or quantitative,
- may reference canonical data elements.

> Methodologies, estimation approaches, or assumptions used in preparing disclosures.

---

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Affected Communities CDIs are distinct from Workforce and Value Chain Worker CDIs.

They describe organisational interaction and exposure, not impact severity.

They do not assert harm, compliance, or legality.

They support mapping to diverse frameworks without embedding regulatory logic.

Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Affected Communities Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing disclosures concerning communities affected by organisational activities or value chain relationships.

By separating community interaction, engagement, and governance from compliance or impact evaluation, the taxonomy enables:

- cross-framework reuse,
- jurisdictional interoperability,
- transparent modelling of social exposure,
- future expansion without semantic drift.
