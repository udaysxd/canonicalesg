# Waste Disclosure Intent Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Waste Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for waste-related sustainability disclosures.

The Waste taxonomy enumerates a stable set of disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested waste-related information across sustainability reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of any reporting standard or regulation,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assert environmental impact, harm, or compliance,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Waste CDIs treat waste as an **operational output stream**, not as a proxy for environmental impact, circularity performance, or regulatory compliance.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Waste disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Waste Generation**
2. **Waste Composition**
3. **Waste Destination**
4. **Waste Handling & Treatment**
5. **Waste Intensity**
6. **Waste Management & Measurement**
7. **Change & Dependency**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 3. Waste Disclosure Intents

### 3.1 Waste Generation

**CDI-WSTE-01**  
**Total waste generated**  
> The total quantity of waste generated by the organisation during the reporting period.

**CDI-WSTE-02**  
**Waste generated by operational boundary**  
> Waste generated, disaggregated by organisational or operational boundary.

---

### 3.2 Waste Composition

**CDI-WSTE-03**  
**Waste by material or category**  
> Waste generated, disaggregated by material type or waste category.

**CDI-WSTE-04**  
**Waste classified as hazardous or non-hazardous**  
> Waste generated, disaggregated by hazardous or non-hazardous classification as defined by the reporting framework.

---

### 3.3 Waste Destination

**CDI-WSTE-05**  
**Waste sent to disposal**  
> Waste directed to final disposal routes.

**CDI-WSTE-06**  
**Waste sent to recycling**  
> Waste directed to recycling processes.

**CDI-WSTE-07**  
**Waste sent to recovery or energy recovery**  
> Waste directed to recovery or energy recovery processes.

**CDI-WSTE-08**  
**Waste sent to reuse**  
> Waste directed to reuse pathways without reprocessing.

**CDI-WSTE-09**  
**Waste destination by type**  
> Waste disaggregated by destination type or treatment outcome.

---

### 3.4 Waste Handling & Treatment

**CDI-WSTE-10**  
**On-site waste handling or treatment**  
> Waste handled or treated within the organisation’s operational boundary.

**CDI-WSTE-11**  
**Off-site waste handling or treatment**  
> Waste transferred to third parties for handling or treatment.

**CDI-WSTE-12**  
**Use of third-party waste contractors**  
> The use of external contractors or facilities for waste management.

---

### 3.5 Waste Intensity

**CDI-WSTE-13**  
**Waste intensity metric**  
> Waste generated normalised by a defined activity, output, or business metric.

**CDI-WSTE-14**  
**Waste data normalisation method**  
> The method used to normalise waste generation or treatment data.

---

### 3.6 Waste Management & Measurement

**CDI-WSTE-15**  
**Waste management practices or systems**  
> The existence of organisational practices or systems for managing waste.

**CDI-WSTE-16**  
**Organisational responsibility for waste management**  
> The assignment of roles or responsibilities for waste-related management.

**CDI-WSTE-17**  
**Processes for measuring or tracking waste**  
> The processes used to measure, estimate, or track waste generation and treatment.

---

### 3.7 Change & Dependency

**CDI-WSTE-18**  
**Changes in waste generation or treatment patterns**  
> Material changes in waste generation, composition, or destination compared to a prior reporting period.

**CDI-WSTE-19**  
**Operational dependency on specific waste treatment routes**  
> Dependency on specific waste treatment or disposal routes for continued operations.

---

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- Waste CDIs are **distinct from pollution, biodiversity, and circular economy CDIs**.
- Waste CDIs focus on operational waste flows, not environmental impact or harm.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements via CMPs.
- Framework-specific nuance is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Waste Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing waste-related disclosure meaning across sustainability reporting frameworks.

By separating operational waste disclosures from regulatory, impact, and circularity considerations, the taxonomy enables consistent data modelling, reuse, and transparent interpretation without embedding judgement or policy assumptions.

## Waste CDI v1 Status

The Waste Disclosure Intent taxonomy defined in this document is **frozen as CDI v1**.

No new Waste CDIs will be added to v1.  
Future extensions will require a new major version.

*Status: Frozen*
