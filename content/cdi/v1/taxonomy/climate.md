# Climate Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Climate Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for climate-related sustainability disclosures.

The taxonomy enumerates a stable set of disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested climate information across global reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of any reporting standard,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assert completeness or compliance,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Climate disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Governance & Strategy**
2. **Risks & Opportunities**
3. **Policies & Commitments**
4. **Targets & Transition Planning**
5. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**
6. **Energy & Mitigation Actions**
7. **Performance & Progress**
8. **Methodology & Assumptions**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

**CDI-CLIM-22**  
**Total energy consumption**  
> Total energy consumed by the organisation.

**CDI-CLIM-23**  
**Renewable energy consumption**  
> Energy consumed from renewable sources.

**CDI-CLIM-24**  
**Energy efficiency initiatives**  
> Actions undertaken to improve energy efficiency.

**CDI-CLIM-25**  
**Use of carbon credits or offsets**

**Progress against climate targets**  
> The organisation's progress toward achieving climate-related targets.

**CDI-CLIM-27**  
**Year-on-year emissions change**  
> Change in greenhouse gas emissions compared to a prior period.

**CDI-CLIM-28**  
**Emissions intensity metric**  
> Emissions normalised by a relevant activity or output metric.

---

### 3.8 Methodology & Assumptions

**CDI-CLIM-29**  
**GHG calculation methodology**  
> The methodology used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions.

**CDI-CLIM-30**  
**Estimation and data quality assumptions**  
> Key assumptions, estimation methods, and data quality considerations.

**CDI-CLIM-31**  
**Use of climate scenarios**  
> Climate scenarios used in risk assessment or planning.

**CDI-CLIM-32**  
**Changes in methodology or boundary**  
> Changes to methodologies, boundaries, or assumptions over time.

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- The taxonomy is **non-exhaustive** and may be extended.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.
- Framework-specific nuance is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Climate Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing climate-related disclosure meaning across reporting frameworks.

By collapsing diverse and evolving disclosure requirements into a manageable set of intents, the taxonomy enables organisations to model climate disclosures once and reuse them globally without loss of meaning.
