Consumers and End-Users Disclosure Intent Taxonomy
1. Purpose

This section defines the Consumers and End-Users Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy for sustainability-related disclosures concerning consumers, customers, and end-users of products or services.

The Consumers and End-Users taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information regarding:

product and service safety,

consumer privacy and data protection,

accessibility and affordability,

responsible marketing and communication,

impacts on vulnerable consumers.

The taxonomy:

is framework-agnostic,

does not prescribe regulatory compliance,

does not evaluate product quality or ethical adequacy,

does not determine liability,

is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Consumers CDIs describe interaction, exposure, protection mechanisms, and governance, not product endorsement or legal judgement.

2. Taxonomy Structure

Consumers and End-Users disclosure intents are grouped into the following domains:

Product and Service Characteristics

Health and Safety

Data Protection and Privacy

Responsible Marketing and Information

Accessibility and Inclusion

Consumer Feedback and Redress

Governance and Reporting

Each disclosure intent:

has a unique identifier,

represents a single semantic concept,

may be narrative or quantitative,

may reference canonical data elements.

4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Consumers CDIs are distinct from Workforce and Affected Communities CDIs.

They focus on organisational interaction with consumers, not regulatory compliance.

They do not assess product effectiveness, legality, or social desirability.

Quantitative disclosures describe counts or occurrences, not thresholds.

Framework interpretation remains exclusively within CMPs.

Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

5. Summary

The CDI v1 Consumers and End-Users Taxonomy defines a stable semantic vocabulary for expressing sustainability disclosures concerning consumers and product or service users.

By separating consumer interaction, protection mechanisms, and governance from regulatory or legal interpretation, the taxonomy enables:

cross-framework reuse,

jurisdictional mapping,

long-term semantic stability,

consistent modelling of consumer-related disclosures.
