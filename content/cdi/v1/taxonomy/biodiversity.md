# Biodiversity Disclosure Intent Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Biodiversity Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for biodiversity-related sustainability disclosures.

The Biodiversity taxonomy enumerates a stable set of disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested biodiversity-related information across sustainability reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of any reporting standard or regulation,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assert ecological impact, significance, or performance,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Biodiversity CDIs describe **organisational interaction with natural systems**, not ecological outcomes, risk assessments, or regulatory classifications.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Biodiversity disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Areas of Interaction**
2. **Type of Interaction**
3. **Dependencies on Natural Systems**
4. **Management & Governance**
5. **Assessment & Monitoring Processes**
6. **Change Over Time**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be narrative, quantitative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 3. Biodiversity Disclosure Intents

### 3.1 Areas of Interaction

**CDI-BIOD-01**  
**Presence of operations in or near natural areas**  
> The presence of organisational operations located in or near natural or semi-natural areas.

**CDI-BIOD-02**  
**Operational land use footprint**  
> The extent or description of land occupied or used for organisational operations.

**CDI-BIOD-03**  
**Operational activities in biodiversity-sensitive contexts**  
> The occurrence of operational activities in contexts considered sensitive for biodiversity.

---

### 3.2 Type of Interaction

**CDI-BIOD-04**  
**Land use or land transformation activities**  
> Organisational activities involving land use, land conversion, or land transformation.

**CDI-BIOD-05**  
**Resource extraction or harvesting activities**  
> Organisational activities involving the extraction or harvesting of natural resources.

**CDI-BIOD-06**  
**Physical disturbance or alteration of natural environments**  
> Activities that physically disturb or alter natural environments as part of operations.

---

### 3.3 Dependencies on Natural Systems

**CDI-BIOD-07**  
**Dependency on ecosystem services**  
> Organisational dependency on ecosystem services such as water provision, soil quality, or pollination.

**CDI-BIOD-08**  
**Dependency on natural habitats or ecosystems**  
> Reliance on the continued availability of natural habitats or ecosystems for operations.

**CDI-BIOD-09**  
**Dependency on biodiversity-related natural resources**  
> Dependency on biological or biodiversity-related natural resources for operational continuity.

---

### 3.4 Management & Governance

**CDI-BIOD-10**  
**Existence of biodiversity-related policies or commitments**  
> The existence of organisational policies or commitments addressing biodiversity-related matters.

**CDI-BIOD-11**  
**Organisational responsibility for biodiversity management**  
> The assignment of roles or responsibilities for managing biodiversity-related interactions.

**CDI-BIOD-12**  
**Integration of biodiversity considerations into operational planning**  
> How biodiversity considerations are incorporated into operational planning or decision-making.

---

### 3.5 Assessment & Monitoring Processes

**CDI-BIOD-13**  
**Processes for identifying biodiversity interactions**  
> Processes used to identify interactions between organisational activities and biodiversity.

**CDI-BIOD-14**  
**Processes for monitoring biodiversity-related interactions**  
> Processes used to monitor or track biodiversity-related interactions over time.

**CDI-BIOD-15**  
**Use of external guidance or frameworks for biodiversity assessment**  
> Reference to external guidance, frameworks, or methodologies used to inform biodiversity-related assessments.

---

### 3.6 Change Over Time

**CDI-BIOD-16**  
**Changes in areas of biodiversity interaction**  
> Changes in the location, extent, or nature of organisational interactions with biodiversity over time.

**CDI-BIOD-17**  
**Changes in biodiversity-related dependencies**  
> Changes in organisational dependencies on biodiversity or ecosystem services compared to a prior period.

**CDI-BIOD-18**  
**Changes in biodiversity management approaches**  
> Changes in policies, practices, or processes related to biodiversity management over time.

---

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- Biodiversity CDIs are **distinct from climate, pollution, water, and waste CDIs**.
- Biodiversity CDIs focus on interaction and dependency, not ecological impact or risk.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements via CMPs.
- Framework-specific interpretation is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Biodiversity Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing biodiversity-related disclosure meaning across sustainability reporting frameworks.

By separating organisational interaction and dependency from ecological impact, performance, and regulatory interpretation, the taxonomy enables consistent data modelling, reuse, and transparent cross-framework mapping without embedding judgement or scientific assessment.

## Biodiversity CDI v1 Status

The Biodiversity Disclosure Intent taxonomy defined in this document is **frozen as CDI v1**.

No new Biodiversity CDIs will be added to v1.  
Future extensions will require a new major version.

*Status: Frozen*
