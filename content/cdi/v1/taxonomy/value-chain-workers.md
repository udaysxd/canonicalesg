Value Chain Workers Disclosure Intent Taxonomy
1. Purpose

This section defines the Value Chain Workers Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy for sustainability disclosures related to workers in an organisation’s upstream and downstream value chain.

The Value Chain Workers taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information concerning workers who are:

not directly employed by the organisation,

but are linked to its operations, products, or services through the value chain.

The taxonomy:

is framework-agnostic,

does not prescribe disclosure obligations,

does not assert compliance with labour law,

does not evaluate fairness or adequacy,

is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Value Chain Workers CDIs describe facts, conditions, processes, and governance structures, not performance or ethical judgement.

2. Taxonomy Structure

Value Chain Workers disclosure intents are grouped into the following domains:

Value Chain Worker Scope

Working Conditions

Labour Practices and Rights

Health and Safety

Engagement and Grievance Mechanisms

Risk Identification and Management

Governance and Reporting

Each disclosure intent:

has a unique identifier,

represents a single semantic concept,

may be narrative or quantitative,

may reference canonical data elements.

3. Value Chain Workers Disclosure Intents

Health and safety risks in the value chain

Identification of occupational health and safety risks affecting value chain workers.

CDI-VCWK-13
Health and safety monitoring practices

Processes used to monitor health and safety conditions in the value chain.

3.5 Engagement and Grievance Mechanisms

CDI-VCWK-14
Engagement with value chain workers

Description of engagement mechanisms involving value chain workers or their representatives.

CDI-VCWK-15
Grievance mechanisms accessible to value chain workers

Existence and description of grievance mechanisms accessible to value chain workers.

CDI-VCWK-16

Processes for addressing identified labour or working condition issues in the value chain.

3.6 Risk Identification and Management

CDI-VCWK-17
Processes for identifying value chain labour risks

Methods used to identify labour-related risks in the value chain.

CDI-VCWK-18
Due diligence processes for value chain workers

Due diligence processes addressing labour and working condition risks.

CDI-VCWK-19

Practices used to assess suppliers or partners on labour-related matters.

3.7 Governance and Reporting

CDI-VCWK-20
Policies related to value chain workers

Existence and scope of organisational policies covering value chain workers.

CDI-VCWK-21
Management responsibility for value chain labour matters

CDI-VCWK-22
Value chain worker reporting boundary

Organisational and operational boundaries applied to value chain worker disclosures.

CDI-VCWK-23
Methodology and assumptions for value chain worker disclosures

Methodologies, estimation approaches, or assumptions used in preparing disclosures.

4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Value Chain Workers CDIs are distinct from Workforce CDIs.

Workforce CDIs apply to directly employed individuals.

Value Chain Workers CDIs apply to non-employed workers linked through the value chain.

CDIs do not assess compliance with labour law.

CDIs do not determine adequacy of wages or fairness of practices.

Framework-specific interpretation is handled exclusively through CMPs.

5. Summary

The CDI v1 Value Chain Workers Taxonomy defines a stable semantic vocabulary for expressing sustainability-related disclosures concerning workers in the value chain.

By separating direct workforce disclosures from value chain labour disclosures, the taxonomy enables:

clear modelling of upstream and downstream labour exposure,

framework-neutral semantic consistency,

cross-jurisdictional interoperability,

long-term extensibility without semantic drift.
