# Governance Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Governance Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for sustainability-related governance disclosures within Canonical ESG.

The Governance taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information about how sustainability-related matters are governed within an organisation, independent of any specific reporting framework or regulation.

The taxonomy:

- is framework-agnostic,
- does not prescribe governance obligations,
- does not assess governance quality or effectiveness,
- does not assert regulatory compliance,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Governance CDIs focus on structures, roles, responsibilities, processes, controls, and transparency mechanisms, not outcomes, performance, or ethical judgement.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Governance disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Oversight Structure**
2. **Roles & Responsibilities**
3. **Governance Processes**
4. **Policies & Commitments**
5. **Business Conduct & Ethics**
6. **Transparency & Public Engagement**
7. **Reporting Scope & Methodology**

Each disclosure intent:

- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- is primarily narrative or structural,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Governance CDIs describe existence, structure, and transparency mechanisms, not effectiveness.

Governance CDIs do not assess outcomes, performance, legal compliance, or ethical quality.

CDIs are independent of jurisdiction-specific legal requirements.

Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.

Framework-specific interpretation is handled exclusively through CMPs.

Deprecated Governance CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI Governance Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing how sustainability-related matters are governed within an organisation.

By separating governance structure, conduct mechanisms, and transparency processes from regulatory interpretation and performance judgement, the taxonomy enables consistent modelling and cross-framework reuse while preserving neutrality.
