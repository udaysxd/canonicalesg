# Standardising the Format of Sustainability Reporting
## Why ESG Now Requires Structural Reform

---

## Executive Summary

Sustainability reporting is entering institutional maturity.

Global frameworks such as ISSB, ESRS, and jurisdictional mandates like CSRD and BRSR are transforming ESG from voluntary narrative to regulated disclosure. However, while recognition rules are consolidating, implementation infrastructure remains fragmented.

Financial reporting achieved stability only when three elements converged:

- **Recognition rules** (IFRS / GAAP)
- **Structured financial statements**
- **Machine-readable infrastructure** (XBRL)

ESG reporting has partially achieved the first.

It lacks the latter two in unified form.

This paper proposes a structural reform approach:

- Introduce minimal, standardised Sustainability Statements
- Stabilise semantic definitions across frameworks
- Enable interoperable machine-readable reporting
- Reduce duplication without altering regulatory authority

**This is not a new standard.**

**It is infrastructure beneath standards.**

## 1. The Structural Maturity Gap

Financial reporting evolved over nearly a century.

ESG reporting has accelerated in less than two decades.

The difference is structural.

### Diagram 1 — Maturity Architecture Comparison

**FINANCIAL REPORTING**

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Recognition Rules | IFRS / GAAP |
| Statement Structure | Balance Sheet, P&L, CF |
| Digital Infrastructure | XBRL Taxonomy |
| Assurance | Mandatory, Mature |
| Comparability | High |

**ESG REPORTING (Today)**

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Recognition Rules | ISSB / ESRS / GRI |
| Statement Structure | Fragmented (Narrative + KPIs) |
| Digital Infrastructure | Partial / Inconsistent Tagging |
| Assurance | Emerging |
| Comparability | Variable |

The gap is not regulatory ambition.

The gap is structural coherence.

---

## 2. The Implementation Problem Beneath Standards

Standards define what must be disclosed.

They do not define:

- Canonical data modelling structures
- Stable semantic identifiers
- Reusable cross-framework architecture
- Structured sustainability statements

As a result:

- Companies remodel the same data multiple times
- Vendors embed proprietary semantics
- Ratings diverge due to measurement differences
- Investors struggle with comparability

This produces what researchers describe as "aggregate confusion."

---

## 3. Economic Consequences of Structural Fragmentation

Fragmented infrastructure generates real financial cost.

### Direct Costs

- Majority of large firms spend >$1m annually on ESG reporting
- Significant compliance duplication across frameworks
- External rating reconciliation expenses

### Indirect Costs

- Higher cost of capital due to reporting uncertainty
- Market volatility following ESG controversies
- Reputational risk amplification

The maturity gap is no longer theoretical.

It is economically measurable.

## 4. Lessons from Financial Reporting Reform

Financial reporting became stable when diversity was organised into structure.

| Statement | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Balance Sheet | Position |
| Income Statement | Performance |
| Cash Flow | Liquidity |

These statements:

- Standardised presentation
- Enabled XBRL tagging
- Reduced interpretive ambiguity
- Created investor-grade comparability

ESG lacks equivalent structured statements.

---

## 5. Proposed Structural Reform

Canonical ESG proposes a two-layer reform:

1. **Structured Sustainability Statements**
2. **Interoperability Infrastructure Layer**

### 5.1 Primary Sustainability Position Statement

A mandatory, minimal structured table.

### Diagram 2 — Sustainability Position Statement (Conceptual Structure)

**SUSTAINABILITY POSITION STATEMENT**

| Metric | Value | Unit | Boundary | Assured |
|--------|-------|------|----------|---------|
| Scope 1 Emissions | XXXX | tCO2e | Org | Yes/No |
| Scope 2 Emissions | XXXX | tCO2e | Org | Yes/No |
| Scope 3 Emissions | XXXX | tCO2e | Value Ch | Yes/No |
| Carbon Removals | XXXX | tCO2e | Org | Yes/No |
| Net Emissions | XXXX | tCO2e | Org | Yes/No |
| Carbon Intensity | XXXX | tCO2e/Rev | Org | Yes/No |
| Baseline Year | 20XX | — | — | — |
| Target Year | 20XX | — | — | — |
| Gap to Target (%) | XX% | — | — | — |

**Purpose:**

- Stabilise core climate metrics
- Enable machine readability
- Anchor comparability

### 5.2 Transition & Target Annex

Structured forward-looking disclosure.

### Diagram 3 — Target Transparency Architecture

**TRANSITION & TARGET ANNEX**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Target Type | Absolute / Intensity |
| Base Year | 20XX |
| Target Year | 20XX |
| Interim Milestones | Yes / No |
| Scope Coverage % | XX% |
| Offset Included | Yes / No |
| Progress % | XX% |
| Methodology | GHG Protocol / Other |

This structure eliminates ambiguity around:

- Baseline manipulation
- Offset treatment
- Scope exclusions
- Conditional targets

---

## 6. Interoperability Infrastructure Layer

Statements alone are insufficient.

They require semantic stabilisation.

### Diagram 4 — Layered Infrastructure Model

```
Layer 3  → Regulatory Mapping Layer (ISSB / ESRS / GRI)
Layer 2  → Stable Semantic Disclosure Identifiers
Layer 1  → Structured Sustainability Statements
--------------------------------------------------------
              Enterprise Data Systems
```

**Key Principles:**

- Report once → map to many
- Framework-neutral semantic anchors
- Version-controlled taxonomy
- JSON / API-ready export
- Compatible with XBRL tagging

This does not replace ISSB or ESRS.

It stabilises implementation beneath them.

---

## 7. Why This Is Not "Another Standard"

This reform:

- Does not redefine materiality
- Does not alter regulatory authority
- Does not introduce new disclosure topics
- Does not compete with XBRL

Instead, it:

- Organises existing metrics into structured statements
- Provides a stable semantic layer
- Enables tagging consistency
- Reduces duplication

**It is architecture, not regulation.**

---

## 8. Alignment with Emerging Regulation

| Initiative | Direction |
|------------|-----------|
| EU CSRD | Structured ESRS data points |
| India BRSR Core | KPI standardisation |
| ISSB | Global baseline |

These initiatives move toward consistency.

Structural interoperability ensures they converge without duplication.

---

## 9. Institutional Benefits

### For Regulators

- Improved supervisory traceability
- Reduced enforcement ambiguity
- Digital filing readiness

### For Investors

- Comparable structured data
- Reduced rating divergence
- Forward-looking clarity

### For Companies

- Lower duplication
- Clearer audit pathways
- Reduced vendor dependency

---

## 10. Strategic Global Positioning

Financial reporting did not mature by accumulating frameworks.

It matured by stabilising structure.

Sustainability reporting is approaching that inflection point.

The next phase requires:

- Minimal structured sustainability statements
- Stable semantic infrastructure
- Interoperable mapping mechanisms

The objective is not regulatory expansion.

The objective is institutional coherence.

**Canonical ESG proposes infrastructure-led maturation** — reinforcing global standards while enabling durable comparability.

### Executive Reform Summary

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **PHASE 1** | Recognition Consolidation — ISSB / ESRS / BRSR → Define What to Disclose |
| **PHASE 2** | Structural Reform (Proposed) — Introduce Structured Sustainability Statements |
| **PHASE 3** | Infrastructure Stabilisation — Semantic Layer + Interoperability Engine |
| **PHASE 4** | Machine-Readable Convergence — XBRL / JSON / API Integration |
