Building a Unified ESG Reporting Foundation for the GCC
A Practical Infrastructure Proposal for Regional Alignment
Executive Summary

Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states are accelerating the development of sustainability disclosure requirements in alignment with global standards. Across the region:

The United Arab Emirates is advancing sustainability regulation through federal initiatives and financial free zones.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is integrating ESG considerations through Vision 2030, the Capital Market Authority (CMA), Tadawul, and the Public Investment Fund (PIF).

Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait are strengthening ESG disclosure guidance through their respective capital market and financial regulators.

Financial free zones, including ADGM and DIFC, are embedding sustainability frameworks within regulatory structures.

Most GCC jurisdictions reference internationally recognised standards, including:

IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB)

Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

TCFD-aligned climate disclosure frameworks

These standards define what should be disclosed, but they do not define:

How sustainability data should be structurally modelled

How disclosures should be harmonised across frameworks

How jurisdiction-specific overlays should be applied without duplicating underlying data

How cross-border interoperability can be preserved across the GCC

This results in implementation fragmentation, duplication of effort, and structural inefficiencies across regulators, companies, advisory firms, and software providers.

This white paper proposes the adoption of a neutral technical reference layer to support consistent and interoperable implementation of sustainability reporting across the GCC.

This proposal does not introduce new standards.
It provides a shared infrastructure beneath existing standards.

1. Regional Context
1.1 Sustainability Acceleration in the GCC

All GCC member states are strengthening sustainability disclosure frameworks in response to:

Global investor expectations

Climate transition commitments

International trade and capital market integration

National development strategies

Each jurisdiction is progressively aligning with ISSB and/or GRI frameworks, while incorporating domestic regulatory requirements.

1.2 Structural Observation

Although frameworks are aligned at a high level, implementation remains structurally fragmented.

Currently:

Data architectures vary across jurisdictions.

Advisory firms interpret frameworks independently.

Software vendors embed proprietary data models.

Regulatory overlays differ in structure rather than only scope.

This creates:

Increased compliance cost for multinational GCC entities

Reduced cross-border comparability

Repeated re-interpretation of identical disclosure concepts

Limited interoperability between ESG platforms

The challenge is not the absence of standards.

It is the absence of a shared implementation infrastructure.

2. The Implementation Infrastructure Gap

Global sustainability standards define:

Disclosure requirements

Conceptual materiality approaches

Thematic topic structures

They do not define:

Canonical data architecture

Stable semantic disclosure identifiers

Framework-independent modelling structures

Explicit separation between data, meaning, and regulation

As a result:

Organisations remodel data per framework.

Regulatory updates require structural redesign.

Interpretive logic becomes embedded within software platforms.

Long-term interoperability is compromised.

This gap can be addressed through a shared technical reference layer.

3. A Neutral Implementation Foundation

A unified ESG reporting foundation would introduce a structured, layered architecture that:

Separates sustainability data from disclosure formatting.

Separates disclosure meaning from regulatory obligation.

Allows frameworks to be applied as transparent overlays.

Preserves auditability and traceability over time.

Enables jurisdictional variation without redefining semantic meaning.

This foundation would not:

Replace ISSB or GRI.

Override national regulatory authority.

Determine materiality.

Assert compliance.

It would provide structured consistency beneath regulatory frameworks.

4. Proposed Layered Architecture

A unified ESG reporting foundation may operate through three distinct layers:

Layer 1 — Core Sustainability Data Model

A neutral, framework-independent structure for modelling:

Metrics

Targets

Trajectories

Organisational boundaries

Geospatial scope

Evidence and assurance

This layer represents factual sustainability data.

It contains no regulatory logic.

Layer 2 — Disclosure Intent Layer

A stable semantic layer defining what an organisation intends to communicate externally, independent of:

Framework numbering

Jurisdictional obligation

Reporting format

Each disclosure concept is uniquely identified and reusable across standards.

Layer 3 — Framework and Jurisdiction Mapping Layer

An interpretation layer that:

Maps disclosure meaning to ISSB and GRI requirements

Documents regulatory overlays

Preserves professional judgement explicitly

Evolves independently of the core data model

This layer ensures regulatory authority remains intact while preventing semantic duplication.

5. Potential Application Across the GCC
5.1 National-Level Adoption

A GCC member state may adopt the infrastructure as:

A voluntary reference model

A recommended technical baseline

A regulator-supported interoperability framework

Companies remain free to comply with global standards.
The infrastructure supports consistent implementation.

5.2 Free Zone Integration

Financial free zones (e.g., ADGM, DIFC, QFC) may adopt structured semantic identifiers to ensure:

Cross-zone comparability

Reduced implementation variance

Clear traceability across frameworks

5.3 GCC Coordination Model

The GCC Secretariat may explore a regional interoperability dialogue based on:

Shared semantic disclosure identifiers

Cross-border equivalence modelling

Alignment of regulatory overlays

This would preserve national sovereignty while enabling regional coherence.

6. Illustrative UAE Implementation Pathway

An illustrative implementation pathway in the UAE may include:

Sustainability data modelled once using a neutral canonical structure.

Disclosure intent defined independently of reporting framework.

ISSB alignment applied via documented interpretation mapping.

UAE-specific regulatory requirements layered without redefining underlying semantic meaning.

This approach:

Reduces duplication across ISSB and domestic regulation.

Supports structured audit traceability.

Enables regulatory updates without data redesign.

Improves investor comparability.

7. Strategic Benefits for GCC Economies

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

Reduce compliance cost for listed companies

Strengthen cross-border capital market integration

Improve transparency for international investors

Encourage interoperability across ESG software providers

Position GCC jurisdictions as leaders in structured ESG implementation

This is not standard-setting.

It is infrastructure strengthening.

8. Governance Considerations

A neutral implementation foundation may operate under:

Ministry-level endorsement

Multi-stakeholder advisory oversight

Transparent versioning and publication

Publicly documented change control

Governance should preserve:

Neutrality

Non-authoritativeness

Transparency

Stability

No regulatory authority is transferred through this model.

9. Phased Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1 — Technical Pilot

Voluntary pilot with selected listed entities.

Evaluation of interoperability benefits.

Phase 2 — Regulator Mapping Publication

Publication of framework alignment documentation.

Documentation of jurisdiction-specific overlays.

Phase 3 — Regional Dialogue

Engagement with GCC regulators and financial authorities.

Exploration of cross-border alignment mechanisms.

Phase 4 — Public Registry and Versioning

Establishment of a transparent versioned registry.

Ongoing stewardship under neutral governance.

10. Conclusion

GCC member states have demonstrated clear commitment to sustainability disclosure and global alignment.

The next stage of maturity is structural coherence.

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

Preserve regulatory authority

Enable interoperability

Reduce duplication

Support long-term economic competitiveness

This proposal presents a practical and non-intrusive infrastructure pathway to strengthen sustainability reporting implementation across the GCC.
