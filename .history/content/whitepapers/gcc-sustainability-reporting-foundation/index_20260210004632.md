# Building a Unified ESG Reporting Foundation for the GCC  
## A Practical Infrastructure Proposal for Regional Alignment  

---

## Executive Summary

Sustainability reporting across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is evolving within a dynamic global regulatory environment. Member states have introduced ESG-related guidance, capital market expectations, and sustainable finance initiatives aligned with international frameworks. However, implementation structures remain at varying stages of development, and regional coordination mechanisms are still emerging.

Across the GCC, sustainability disclosure is increasingly referenced within national transformation strategies, financial market oversight, and climate commitments. Regulatory bodies, stock exchanges, sovereign wealth funds, and financial free zones are progressively integrating ESG considerations into governance and reporting expectations. While important foundations have been established, the operational architecture for consistent, cross-border implementation remains heterogeneous.

At the same time, global sustainability reporting standards — particularly those issued by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) — are gaining rapid international adoption. As capital markets converge around common disclosure baselines, GCC jurisdictions face a strategic opportunity: not merely to align with global standards individually, but to strengthen regional coherence in how those standards are implemented.

Global climate commitments under the Paris Agreement (2015), reinforced through successive Conference of the Parties (COP) processes — including COP26 (Glasgow), COP27 (Sharm El-Sheikh), and COP28 (Dubai) — have accelerated the translation of climate ambition into regulatory and financial disclosure expectations. At the same time, the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) under the IFRS Foundation has created a globally coordinated sustainability disclosure baseline for capital markets.

Across the GCC, member states are progressively integrating sustainability disclosure into financial regulation, capital market supervision, and national transformation strategies.

The United Arab Emirates has embedded sustainability within federal economic policy, introduced ESG disclosure guidance through the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and advanced sustainable finance frameworks within ADGM and DIFC. The UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative further reinforces long-term climate disclosure expectations.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has incorporated ESG within Vision 2030 reforms, with ESG disclosure guidance issued by the Capital Market Authority (CMA), sustainability initiatives advanced through the Saudi Exchange (Tadawul), and ESG integration embedded within the Public Investment Fund (PIF).

Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and Kuwait have each introduced ESG or sustainability disclosure guidance through their respective capital market regulators and stock exchanges. Sustainability transparency is increasingly expected within annual reporting cycles, with progressive alignment toward international standards including IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB), GRI, and TCFD-aligned climate frameworks.

While regulatory direction across the GCC demonstrates convergence toward international standards, implementation architectures remain heterogeneous.

Global standards define what should be disclosed.  
They do not define how sustainability data should be structurally modelled, how disclosure meaning should remain stable across frameworks, or how jurisdiction-specific overlays should be applied without duplicating underlying data.

As disclosure requirements expand, implementation complexity increases. Without shared structural infrastructure:

- interpretation may diverge across jurisdictions,
- advisory and software providers may embed framework semantics directly into data models,
- multinational GCC entities may duplicate reporting logic across regimes,
- cross-border comparability may weaken despite standard alignment.

The next stage of regional sustainability leadership is therefore not the creation of new standards, but the harmonisation of implementation beneath existing standards.

This white paper proposes the development of a neutral, technical sustainability reporting infrastructure layer designed to:

- preserve alignment with global standards,
- reduce implementation divergence,
- enhance comparability across GCC capital markets,
- strengthen regional regulatory coherence,
- and support long-term institutional stability.

The proposal does not introduce new disclosure requirements.  
It does not replace ISSB, GRI, or national regulation.  

It provides shared structural infrastructure beneath them — enabling each GCC jurisdiction to retain regulatory sovereignty while benefiting from regional coherence and implementation stability.

## Regional Sustainability Reporting Landscape in the GCC

### 1. Global Institutional Context

The evolution of sustainability reporting within the GCC must be understood within a broader global institutional transformation.

The Paris Agreement established binding international climate commitments requiring transparency, accountability, and measurable progress. Subsequent COP processes have shifted focus from ambition to implementation, with increasing emphasis on credible disclosure and financial system alignment.

The creation of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) marked a structural turning point by establishing a global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures. IFRS S1 (General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information) and IFRS S2 (Climate-related Disclosures) are increasingly referenced by regulators worldwide.

GCC jurisdictions are aligning with this global baseline while preserving national economic priorities and legal structures.

---

### 2. United Arab Emirates

The United Arab Emirates has taken a leading role in regional sustainability governance.

- The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) introduced ESG disclosure guidance for listed companies beginning in 2020, integrating sustainability considerations within annual reporting.
- Federal sustainability strategies, including the UAE Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative, embed long-term climate objectives within economic planning.
- Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) have incorporated sustainable finance and ESG disclosure expectations within financial regulatory rulebooks.
- COP28, hosted in Dubai, elevated expectations around implementation credibility and measurable progress.

Regulatory alignment with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is anticipated to strengthen as global adoption accelerates.

---

### 3. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia has embedded ESG considerations within Vision 2030 and financial market reform programmes.

- The Capital Market Authority (CMA) has issued ESG Disclosure Guidelines for listed companies.
- The Saudi Exchange (Tadawul) has advanced sustainability reporting guidance aligned with international best practices.
- The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has integrated ESG governance and disclosure within its portfolio oversight framework.
- Climate-related financial disclosure expectations are under progressive development.

Saudi Arabia’s approach reflects gradual strengthening of disclosure depth while maintaining alignment with international capital market standards.

---

### 4. Qatar

The Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA) requires listed companies to publish ESG or sustainability reports.

- ESG disclosure guidance promotes structured reporting aligned with international standards.
- Climate governance and transparency expectations are increasing.
- Regulatory formalisation continues to evolve within the broader Qatar National Vision 2030 framework.

---

### 5. Bahrain

The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) and Bahrain Bourse have introduced ESG reporting guidance for listed entities and financial institutions.

- Sustainability transparency is increasingly incorporated into annual reporting cycles.
- Financial institutions face enhanced governance expectations relating to sustainability risk.
- Alignment with international standards is encouraged rather than replaced.

---

### 6. Oman

Oman’s Capital Market Authority has issued ESG reporting guidelines for listed companies.

- Sustainability transparency aligns with Oman Vision 2040 objectives.
- Climate and environmental disclosure expectations are strengthening.
- Structured implementation remains heterogeneous across sectors.

---

### 7. Kuwait

Boursa Kuwait has introduced ESG reporting guidance to promote transparency among listed entities.

- ESG disclosure is increasingly expected within annual reporting.
- Formal regulatory codification continues to evolve in line with global developments.

---

### 8. Financial Free Zones

Independent financial free zones across the GCC, including ADGM and DIFC, operate under regulatory architectures aligned with international financial standards.

- Sustainable finance frameworks and ESG-related disclosure expectations are embedded within regulatory structures.
- Anticipated adoption or alignment with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards will further influence implementation architectures.

---

### 9. Regional Structural Observation

Across the GCC:

- Sustainability disclosure is transitioning from guidance-based to progressively structured regulatory expectation.
- Jurisdictions are converging around ISSB, GRI, and climate-related financial disclosure principles.
- Capital markets increasingly expect decision-useful sustainability information.

However, while regulatory alignment exists at the level of standards, implementation infrastructure remains fragmented.

The absence of shared structural architecture risks:

- duplicated modelling efforts,
- inconsistent interpretation across advisory and software providers,
- rising compliance cost for cross-border entities,
- reduced comparability across GCC capital markets.

As sustainability governance matures across the region, implementation coherence becomes the next policy frontier.

### Regional Free Zones

Financial free zones including ADGM and DIFC operate under independent regulatory frameworks aligned with international financial market standards.

- Sustainable finance frameworks and ESG-related disclosure expectations are embedded within their rulebooks.
- IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards adoption is anticipated to influence implementation structures.

---

## Regional Structural Observation

Across the GCC:

- Most jurisdictions reference or align with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB), GRI, or TCFD-aligned climate frameworks.
- Regulatory bodies increasingly expect structured sustainability disclosures within annual reporting cycles.
- Climate-related transparency is transitioning from voluntary to progressively structured expectation.

However, implementation architectures vary significantly across jurisdictions and institutions.

While global standards define what should be disclosed, they do not define:

- how sustainability data should be structurally modelled,
- how disclosures should be harmonised across multiple frameworks,
- how jurisdiction-specific overlays should be applied without duplicating underlying data,
- how cross-border comparability can be preserved across GCC capital markets.

This results in:

- duplicated modelling efforts,
- inconsistent interpretation across advisory and software providers,
- rising compliance cost for multinational GCC entities,
- structural fragmentation across otherwise aligned standards.

The next stage of regional maturity requires implementation coherence beneath standards.

This white paper proposes the development of a neutral technical infrastructure layer to support consistent, interoperable sustainability reporting implementation across GCC jurisdictions.

This proposal does not introduce new standards.

It provides shared structural infrastructure beneath existing standards.

## 1. Regional Context

### 1.1 Sustainability Acceleration in the GCC

All GCC member states are strengthening sustainability disclosure frameworks in response to:

- Global investor expectations
- Climate transition commitments
- International trade and capital market integration
- National development strategies

Each jurisdiction is progressively aligning with ISSB and/or GRI frameworks, while incorporating domestic regulatory requirements.

### 1.2 Structural Observation

Although frameworks are aligned at a high level, implementation remains structurally fragmented.

Currently:

- Data architectures vary across jurisdictions
- Advisory firms interpret frameworks independently
- Software vendors embed proprietary data models
- Regulatory overlays differ structurally rather than only by scope

This creates:

- Increased compliance cost for multinational GCC entities
- Reduced cross-border comparability
- Repeated re-interpretation of identical disclosure concepts
- Limited interoperability between ESG platforms

The challenge is not the absence of standards.  
It is the absence of shared implementation infrastructure.

---
## 2. The Implementation Infrastructure Gap

International sustainability standards have achieved significant conceptual convergence over the past decade. Frameworks such as the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and climate-related disclosure architectures influenced by the TCFD provide structured disclosure requirements, thematic topic groupings, and materiality-based reporting logic.

These frameworks define what should be disclosed and, increasingly, why such disclosures are relevant to capital markets, regulators, and stakeholders.

However, they do not prescribe how sustainability information should be structurally modelled within enterprise systems, how disclosure meaning should be stabilised across multiple frameworks, or how regulatory overlays should be applied without duplicating underlying data.

In particular, global standards do not define:

- A canonical data architecture for sustainability metrics and assertions  
- Stable, framework-independent semantic identifiers for disclosure meaning  
- A structured separation between raw sustainability data, disclosure intent, and jurisdictional regulatory obligation  
- A reusable modelling layer capable of supporting multiple reporting regimes simultaneously  

As a result, implementation practices vary significantly across jurisdictions, advisory firms, and software platforms.

In the absence of shared technical reference infrastructure:

- Organisations frequently remodel sustainability data for each reporting framework adopted.  
- Regulatory updates may require costly structural redesign of reporting systems rather than targeted interpretive adjustments.  
- Interpretive logic becomes embedded directly into proprietary software architectures, reducing transparency and portability.  
- Cross-border comparability is weakened, even where formal alignment with global standards exists.  
- Long-term interoperability between GCC markets and international capital systems becomes dependent on vendor-specific implementation approaches.  

This structural fragmentation does not arise from divergence in standards themselves. Rather, it emerges from the absence of a neutral implementation layer beneath them.

As sustainability disclosure regimes evolve within the GCC, the policy question gradually shifts from which standards to reference toward how those standards are operationalised consistently, efficiently, and in a manner that supports cross-border comparability.

The implementation infrastructure gap therefore represents a technical and institutional opportunity.

By establishing a shared, neutral reference layer for modelling sustainability data and disclosure semantics — without altering global standards or national regulatory authority — GCC jurisdictions could reduce duplication, enhance comparability, and strengthen long-term regulatory coherence.

Such an approach would support global alignment while preserving sovereign regulatory discretion.

## 3. A Neutral Implementation Foundation

A unified ESG reporting foundation would introduce a structured layered architecture that:

1. Separates sustainability data from disclosure formatting  
2. Separates disclosure meaning from regulatory obligation  
3. Allows frameworks to be applied as transparent overlays  
4. Preserves auditability and traceability over time  
5. Enables jurisdictional variation without redefining semantic meaning  

This foundation would not:

- Replace ISSB or GRI  
- Override national regulatory authority  
- Determine materiality  
- Assert compliance  

It provides structured consistency beneath regulatory frameworks.

---

## 4. Proposed Layered Architecture

### Layer 1 — Core Sustainability Data Model

A neutral, framework-independent structure for modelling:

- Metrics  
- Targets  
- Trajectories  
- Organisational boundaries  
- Geospatial scope  
- Evidence and assurance  

This layer represents factual sustainability data.  
It contains no regulatory logic.

---

### Layer 2 — Disclosure Intent Layer

A stable semantic layer defining what an organisation intends to communicate externally, independent of:

- Framework numbering  
- Jurisdictional obligation  
- Reporting format  

Each disclosure concept is uniquely identified and reusable across standards.

---

### Layer 3 — Framework and Jurisdiction Mapping Layer

An interpretation layer that:

- Maps disclosure meaning to ISSB and GRI requirements  
- Documents regulatory overlays  
- Preserves professional judgement explicitly  
- Evolves independently of the core data model  

This layer ensures regulatory authority remains intact while preventing semantic duplication.

---

## 5. Potential Application Across the GCC

### 5.1 National-Level Adoption

A GCC member state may adopt the infrastructure as:

- A voluntary reference model  
- A recommended technical baseline  
- A regulator-supported interoperability framework  

Companies remain free to comply with global standards.  
The infrastructure supports consistent implementation.

---

### 5.2 Free Zone Integration

Financial free zones may adopt structured semantic identifiers to ensure:

- Cross-zone comparability  
- Reduced implementation variance  
- Clear traceability across frameworks  

---

### 5.3 GCC Coordination Model

The GCC Secretariat may explore a regional interoperability dialogue based on:

- Shared semantic disclosure identifiers  
- Cross-border equivalence modelling  
- Alignment of regulatory overlays  

This preserves national sovereignty while enabling regional coherence.

---

## 6. Illustrative UAE Implementation Pathway

An illustrative implementation pathway may include:

1. Sustainability data modelled once using a neutral canonical structure  
2. Disclosure intent defined independently of reporting framework  
3. ISSB alignment applied via documented interpretation mapping  
4. UAE-specific regulatory requirements layered without redefining semantic meaning  

This approach:

- Reduces duplication across ISSB and domestic regulation  
- Supports structured audit traceability  
- Enables regulatory updates without data redesign  
- Improves investor comparability  

---

## 7. Strategic Benefits for GCC Economies

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

- Reduce compliance cost for listed companies  
- Strengthen cross-border capital market integration  
- Improve transparency for international investors  
- Encourage interoperability across ESG software providers  
- Position GCC jurisdictions as leaders in structured ESG implementation  

This is not standard-setting.  
It is infrastructure strengthening.

---

## 8. Governance Considerations

A neutral implementation foundation may operate under:

- Ministry-level endorsement  
- Multi-stakeholder advisory oversight  
- Transparent versioning and publication  
- Publicly documented change control  

Governance should preserve:

- Neutrality  
- Non-authoritativeness  
- Transparency  
- Stability  

No regulatory authority is transferred through this model.

---

## 9. Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Technical Pilot

- Voluntary pilot with selected listed entities  
- Evaluation of interoperability benefits  

### Phase 2 — Regulator Mapping Publication

- Publication of framework alignment documentation  
- Documentation of jurisdiction-specific overlays  

### Phase 3 — Regional Dialogue

- Engagement with GCC regulators and financial authorities  
- Exploration of cross-border alignment mechanisms  

### Phase 4 — Public Registry and Versioning

- Establishment of a transparent versioned registry  
- Ongoing stewardship under neutral governance  

---

## 10. Conclusion

GCC member states have demonstrated clear commitment to sustainability disclosure and global alignment.

The next stage of maturity is structural coherence.

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

- Preserve regulatory authority  
- Enable interoperability  
- Reduce duplication  
- Support long-term economic competitiveness  

This proposal presents a practical and non-intrusive infrastructure pathway to strengthen sustainability reporting implementation across the GCC.
