## Executive Summary

## Executive Summary

Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states are entering a new phase of sustainability regulation marked by accelerating disclosure requirements, capital market integration, and international alignment.

Across the region, sustainability reporting is transitioning from voluntary guidance toward progressively structured regulatory frameworks.

### United Arab Emirates

The United Arab Emirates has embedded sustainability within federal economic policy and capital market oversight.

- The UAE Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) introduced ESG disclosure guidance for listed companies in 2020, requiring sustainability reporting within annual disclosures.
- UAE-listed companies are increasingly expected to align with global standards such as GRI and ISSB-aligned reporting.
- The Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) and Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) have introduced sustainable finance frameworks and ESG disclosure expectations aligned with international financial market practices.
- The UAE’s Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative reinforces forward-looking climate disclosure expectations.

Regulatory expectations are expanding, with increasing alignment to IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards anticipated as global adoption accelerates.

### Kingdom of Saudi Arabia

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has integrated ESG within Vision 2030 and financial market reform programs.

- The Capital Market Authority (CMA) has issued ESG Disclosure Guidelines for listed companies.
- Tadawul (Saudi Exchange) has introduced ESG reporting guidance encouraging sustainability disclosure aligned with global frameworks.
- The Public Investment Fund (PIF) has embedded ESG governance and reporting within its portfolio oversight strategy.
- Mandatory climate-related financial disclosure aligned with international frameworks is under active policy evolution.

Saudi Arabia is progressively strengthening disclosure depth while maintaining alignment with global sustainability standards.

---

### Qatar

Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA) requires listed companies to publish ESG or sustainability reports.

- ESG disclosure guidance has been issued to promote structured sustainability reporting.
- Alignment with GRI and international best practices is encouraged.
- Regulatory development is ongoing, particularly in climate-related transparency and governance disclosures.

---

### Bahrain

The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) and Bahrain Bourse have introduced ESG reporting guidance for listed entities.

- Sustainability reporting is increasingly expected within annual reporting cycles.
- Financial institutions are subject to enhanced ESG-related risk governance requirements.
- Alignment with international disclosure frameworks is encouraged rather than replaced.

---

### Oman

The Capital Market Authority (CMA Oman) has issued ESG reporting guidelines for listed companies.

- ESG disclosure requirements are being progressively formalised.
- Sustainability transparency is embedded within Oman Vision 2040 objectives.
- Climate and environmental disclosure expectations are increasing, though structured implementation remains heterogeneous.

---

### Kuwait

Boursa Kuwait has introduced ESG reporting guidance to promote transparency among listed companies.

- ESG disclosure is encouraged and increasingly expected within annual reporting.
- Formal regulatory codification is evolving in line with international developments.

---

### Regional Free Zones

Financial free zones including ADGM and DIFC operate under independent regulatory frameworks aligned with international financial market standards.

- Sustainable finance frameworks and ESG-related disclosure expectations are embedded within their rulebooks.
- IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards adoption is anticipated to influence implementation structures.

---

## Regional Structural Observation

Across the GCC:

- Most jurisdictions reference or align with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards (ISSB), GRI, or TCFD-aligned climate frameworks.
- Regulatory bodies increasingly expect structured sustainability disclosures within annual reporting cycles.
- Climate-related transparency is transitioning from voluntary to progressively structured expectation.

However, implementation architectures vary significantly across jurisdictions and institutions.

While global standards define what should be disclosed, they do not define:

- how sustainability data should be structurally modelled,
- how disclosures should be harmonised across multiple frameworks,
- how jurisdiction-specific overlays should be applied without duplicating underlying data,
- how cross-border comparability can be preserved across GCC capital markets.

This results in:

- duplicated modelling efforts,
- inconsistent interpretation across advisory and software providers,
- rising compliance cost for multinational GCC entities,
- structural fragmentation across otherwise aligned standards.

The next stage of regional maturity requires implementation coherence beneath standards.

This white paper proposes the development of a neutral technical infrastructure layer to support consistent, interoperable sustainability reporting implementation across GCC jurisdictions.

This proposal does not introduce new standards.

It provides shared structural infrastructure beneath existing standards.


---

## 1. Regional Context

### 1.1 Sustainability Acceleration in the GCC

All GCC member states are strengthening sustainability disclosure frameworks in response to:

- Global investor expectations
- Climate transition commitments
- International trade and capital market integration
- National development strategies

Each jurisdiction is progressively aligning with ISSB and/or GRI frameworks, while incorporating domestic regulatory requirements.

### 1.2 Structural Observation

Although frameworks are aligned at a high level, implementation remains structurally fragmented.

Currently:

- Data architectures vary across jurisdictions
- Advisory firms interpret frameworks independently
- Software vendors embed proprietary data models
- Regulatory overlays differ structurally rather than only by scope

This creates:

- Increased compliance cost for multinational GCC entities
- Reduced cross-border comparability
- Repeated re-interpretation of identical disclosure concepts
- Limited interoperability between ESG platforms

The challenge is not the absence of standards.  
It is the absence of shared implementation infrastructure.

---

## 2. The Implementation Infrastructure Gap

Global sustainability standards define:

- Disclosure requirements
- Conceptual materiality approaches
- Thematic topic structures

They do not define:

- Canonical data architecture
- Stable semantic disclosure identifiers
- Framework-independent modelling structures
- Explicit separation between data, meaning, and regulation

As a result:

- Organisations remodel data per framework
- Regulatory updates require structural redesign
- Interpretive logic becomes embedded within software platforms
- Long-term interoperability is compromised

This gap can be addressed through a shared technical reference layer.

---

## 3. A Neutral Implementation Foundation

A unified ESG reporting foundation would introduce a structured layered architecture that:

1. Separates sustainability data from disclosure formatting  
2. Separates disclosure meaning from regulatory obligation  
3. Allows frameworks to be applied as transparent overlays  
4. Preserves auditability and traceability over time  
5. Enables jurisdictional variation without redefining semantic meaning  

This foundation would not:

- Replace ISSB or GRI  
- Override national regulatory authority  
- Determine materiality  
- Assert compliance  

It provides structured consistency beneath regulatory frameworks.

---

## 4. Proposed Layered Architecture

### Layer 1 — Core Sustainability Data Model

A neutral, framework-independent structure for modelling:

- Metrics  
- Targets  
- Trajectories  
- Organisational boundaries  
- Geospatial scope  
- Evidence and assurance  

This layer represents factual sustainability data.  
It contains no regulatory logic.

---

### Layer 2 — Disclosure Intent Layer

A stable semantic layer defining what an organisation intends to communicate externally, independent of:

- Framework numbering  
- Jurisdictional obligation  
- Reporting format  

Each disclosure concept is uniquely identified and reusable across standards.

---

### Layer 3 — Framework and Jurisdiction Mapping Layer

An interpretation layer that:

- Maps disclosure meaning to ISSB and GRI requirements  
- Documents regulatory overlays  
- Preserves professional judgement explicitly  
- Evolves independently of the core data model  

This layer ensures regulatory authority remains intact while preventing semantic duplication.

---

## 5. Potential Application Across the GCC

### 5.1 National-Level Adoption

A GCC member state may adopt the infrastructure as:

- A voluntary reference model  
- A recommended technical baseline  
- A regulator-supported interoperability framework  

Companies remain free to comply with global standards.  
The infrastructure supports consistent implementation.

---

### 5.2 Free Zone Integration

Financial free zones may adopt structured semantic identifiers to ensure:

- Cross-zone comparability  
- Reduced implementation variance  
- Clear traceability across frameworks  

---

### 5.3 GCC Coordination Model

The GCC Secretariat may explore a regional interoperability dialogue based on:

- Shared semantic disclosure identifiers  
- Cross-border equivalence modelling  
- Alignment of regulatory overlays  

This preserves national sovereignty while enabling regional coherence.

---

## 6. Illustrative UAE Implementation Pathway

An illustrative implementation pathway may include:

1. Sustainability data modelled once using a neutral canonical structure  
2. Disclosure intent defined independently of reporting framework  
3. ISSB alignment applied via documented interpretation mapping  
4. UAE-specific regulatory requirements layered without redefining semantic meaning  

This approach:

- Reduces duplication across ISSB and domestic regulation  
- Supports structured audit traceability  
- Enables regulatory updates without data redesign  
- Improves investor comparability  

---

## 7. Strategic Benefits for GCC Economies

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

- Reduce compliance cost for listed companies  
- Strengthen cross-border capital market integration  
- Improve transparency for international investors  
- Encourage interoperability across ESG software providers  
- Position GCC jurisdictions as leaders in structured ESG implementation  

This is not standard-setting.  
It is infrastructure strengthening.

---

## 8. Governance Considerations

A neutral implementation foundation may operate under:

- Ministry-level endorsement  
- Multi-stakeholder advisory oversight  
- Transparent versioning and publication  
- Publicly documented change control  

Governance should preserve:

- Neutrality  
- Non-authoritativeness  
- Transparency  
- Stability  

No regulatory authority is transferred through this model.

---

## 9. Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Technical Pilot

- Voluntary pilot with selected listed entities  
- Evaluation of interoperability benefits  

### Phase 2 — Regulator Mapping Publication

- Publication of framework alignment documentation  
- Documentation of jurisdiction-specific overlays  

### Phase 3 — Regional Dialogue

- Engagement with GCC regulators and financial authorities  
- Exploration of cross-border alignment mechanisms  

### Phase 4 — Public Registry and Versioning

- Establishment of a transparent versioned registry  
- Ongoing stewardship under neutral governance  

---

## 10. Conclusion

GCC member states have demonstrated clear commitment to sustainability disclosure and global alignment.

The next stage of maturity is structural coherence.

A unified ESG reporting foundation would:

- Preserve regulatory authority  
- Enable interoperability  
- Reduce duplication  
- Support long-term economic competitiveness  

This proposal presents a practical and non-intrusive infrastructure pathway to strengthen sustainability reporting implementation across the GCC.
