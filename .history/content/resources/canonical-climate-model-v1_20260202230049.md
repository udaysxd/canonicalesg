# Canonical Climate Model v1

## Overview

The Canonical Climate Model v1 provides a complete, framework-agnostic reference for structuring, interpreting, and reusing climate-related sustainability disclosures.

It represents the first stable climate topic implementation of the Canonical ESG architecture.

This model is designed to support:
- corporate sustainability reporting,
- cross-framework disclosure reuse,
- auditability and traceability,
- software system implementation.

It does not define reporting obligations or assert regulatory authority.

## What the Canonical Climate Model Includes

The Canonical Climate Model v1 consists of three distinct but connected layers:

### 1. Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM)

CERM defines the canonical data structures used to represent climate-related information, such as greenhouse gas emissions, targets, boundaries, and methodologies.

It focuses on *how data is modelled*, independent of reporting standards.

---

### 2. Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

CDIs define the semantic meaning of climate disclosures — what an organisation is communicating — without reference to specific frameworks.

Climate CDI v1 includes:
- 32 atomic climate disclosure intents,
- coverage across emissions, targets, governance, assurance, and transition planning,
- stable identifiers designed for long-term reuse.

---

### 3. Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP)

CMPs document how disclosure intents are interpreted by specific sustainability reporting frameworks.

The Climate CMP v0.3:
- maps 32 climate disclosure intents,
- references ESRS E1, GRI 305, and CDP Climate,
- is frozen as a non-authoritative reference implementation.

CMPs make interpretation decisions explicit and reviewable without asserting compliance.

## What This Model Enables

The Canonical Climate Model v1 enables organisations to:

- model climate data once and reuse it across frameworks,
- separate data, meaning, and interpretation cleanly,
- reduce duplicated interpretation effort,
- improve consistency and auditability of disclosures,
- support both human reporting and machine automation.

---

## What This Model Does Not Do

The Canonical Climate Model v1 does not:

- define mandatory disclosures,
- determine materiality,
- assess performance or ambition,
- replace professional judgement,
- act as an official interpretation of any framework.

Users remain responsible for regulatory compliance and reporting decisions.

---

## Status and Governance

Canonical Climate Model v1 is:
- publicly documented,
- versioned,
- licensed for reuse under CC BY 4.0,
- maintained by Canonical ESG.

Future updates will follow documented versioning and change control processes.

---

## Relationship to Reporting Frameworks

This model is designed to coexist with existing sustainability reporting frameworks, including but not limited to:

- ESRS
- GRI
- CDP
- ISSB
- TCFD

Framework texts remain authoritative.

---

## Intended Audience

This document is intended for:
- sustainability practitioners,
- auditors and assurance providers,
- consultants,
- software architects and platform builders,
- standards observers.

---

## Summary

The Canonical Climate Model v1 demonstrates that climate disclosures can be modelled, interpreted, and reused systematically without centralising authority or redefining standards.

It provides a shared reference point for improving clarity, consistency, and interoperability in climate reporting.
