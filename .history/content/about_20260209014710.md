# About Canonical ESG

Canonical ESG is an independent semantic infrastructure initiative designed to establish a stable, framework-neutral foundation for sustainability disclosures.

Sustainability reporting standards continue to evolve across jurisdictions, regulators, and voluntary bodies. While the number of frameworks has expanded, many of the underlying disclosure concepts overlap. Canonical ESG addresses this fragmentation at the structural level — by separating semantic meaning from regulatory interpretation.

It does not introduce new reporting requirements.  
It provides structural modelling infrastructure beneath existing standards and regulations.

## The Canonical ESG Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through a three-layer architecture designed to maintain semantic stability while enabling interpretive flexibility.

### Layer 1 — Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

CDI defines a stable, framework-independent semantic model that captures the meaning of sustainability disclosures without embedding regulatory or jurisdictional logic.

Each CDI represents a single durable disclosure concept, such as:

- Greenhouse gas emissions  
- Governance oversight  
- Workforce composition  
- Biodiversity interaction  
- Economic value generation  
- Risk and opportunity management  

CDIs are:

- Framework-neutral  
- Jurisdiction-neutral  
- Legally non-authoritative  
- Version-controlled and semantically stable  
- Designed for long-term interoperability  

CDI defines meaning only.  
It does not interpret regulation, determine applicability, or assert compliance.

CDI v1 is frozen as a stable semantic baseline.

### Layer 2 — Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP)

CMPs interpret CDIs across voluntary standards and global disclosure frameworks.

This layer enables:

- Cross-framework interoperability  
- Structural equivalence analysis  
- Multi-standard reuse of a single semantic model  
- Transparent modelling of interpretive differences  

CMPs preserve semantic integrity.

They do not alter CDI meaning.  
They document how specific standards interpret that meaning.

CMPs evolve transparently as standards evolve.

### Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Jurisdictional Mapping models how regulatory regimes translate sustainability disclosures into legal obligations.

This layer enables:

- Regulatory alignment modelling  
- Double materiality interpretation  
- Value-chain scope modelling  
- Taxonomy alignment representation  
- Legal architecture modelling without semantic distortion  

Jurisdiction layers reflect regulatory logic.

They do not redefine semantic meaning.  
They make regulatory interpretation explicit without embedding it into the canonical layer.

## What Canonical ESG Is — and Is Not

Canonical ESG does not replace sustainability standards.

It does not issue compliance guidance.  
It does not provide legal interpretation.  
It does not determine materiality or regulatory applicability.

Framework texts remain authoritative.

Canonical ESG provides structural infrastructure beneath standards and regulations, enabling:

- Semantic consistency  
- Cross-standard comparability  
- Transparent interpretation  
- Regulatory modelling without semantic drift  
- Long-term stability amid evolving disclosure regimes  

Canonical ESG is infrastructure — not advisory, not regulatory, and not commercial compliance tooling.

## Current Stewardship

Canonical ESG is currently stewarded by its founding architect, [Uday Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/udsingh1/), during its initial infrastructure phase.

The steward is professionally engaged in sustainability technical consulting work; Canonical ESG operates independently and does not provide advisory, assurance, or commercial services.

To mitigate conflict risk and preserve neutrality:

- The initiative maintains a strict non-authoritative position.  
- Framework interpretation is documented transparently.  
- Version discipline is applied consistently.  
- Infrastructure outputs are separated from any consulting engagement.

The current phase focuses on:

- Establishing CDI v1 as a stable semantic baseline  
- Achieving comprehensive cross-framework coverage  
- Modelling major global regulatory regimes  
- Formalising contribution processes  
- Developing governance structures  

The initiative is designed to transition toward multi-stakeholder stewardship as participation expands.

The long-term objective is to evolve into a durable, institutionally governed public infrastructure initiative serving the sustainability reporting ecosystem.

Stewardship at this stage is infrastructural, not proprietary.

## Institutional Direction

Canonical ESG is being built with the structural discipline of a standard-setting architecture, not the velocity of a startup initiative.

Its development model prioritises:

- Semantic integrity  
- Version discipline  
- Framework neutrality  
- Non-authoritative positioning  
- Transparent interpretive modelling  
- Long-term institutional viability  

The initiative is intended to grow through:

- Technical contribution  
- Collaborative participation  
- Open infrastructure governance  
- Multi-stakeholder oversight  

Canonical ESG is designed as durable infrastructure for a reporting ecosystem that increasingly requires interoperability, traceability, and structural clarity.
