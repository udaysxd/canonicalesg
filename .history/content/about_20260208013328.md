# About Canonical ESG

Canonical ESG is an independent infrastructure initiative designed to establish a stable, framework-neutral semantic foundation for sustainability disclosures.

Sustainability reporting standards continue to evolve across jurisdictions, regulators, and voluntary bodies. While the number of frameworks has grown, the underlying semantic concepts they request often overlap. Canonical ESG addresses this fragmentation at the structural level.

## The Canonical ESG Architecture

The Canonical ESG architecture is built on three layers:

### Layer 1 — Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

A stable, framework-independent semantic model that defines disclosure meaning without embedding regulatory interpretation.

CDIs represent durable disclosure concepts such as emissions, governance oversight, workforce composition, biodiversity interaction, economic value generation, and risk management.

CDIs are:

- Framework neutral
- Jurisdiction neutral
- Legally non-authoritative
- Version-controlled and semantically stable

### Layer 2 — Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP)

CMPs interpret CDIs across voluntary and global frameworks.

This layer enables:

- Cross-framework interoperability
- Structural equivalence analysis
- Reuse of a single semantic model across multiple standards

### Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Jurisdiction CMPs model how regulatory regimes interpret disclosure obligations.

This layer enables:

- Regulatory alignment modelling
- Double materiality interpretation
- Taxonomy alignment modelling
- Legal architecture representation without altering semantic meaning

## Canonical ESG does not replace standards

It provides a structural foundation beneath them.
