# Architecture

## 1. Architectural Intent

The Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM) is designed as a layered reference architecture that separates sustainability data, semantic meaning, framework interpretation, and disclosure presentation.

The architecture enables organisations to:

- Model sustainability information once  
- Reuse that information across multiple reporting frameworks  
- Preserve traceability and audit integrity  
- Adapt to evolving standards without restructuring core data models  

CERM defines conceptual layers and explicit contracts between them.  
It does not prescribe implementation technologies, deployment models, or software architectures.

Its purpose is structural clarity and semantic stability.

---

## 2. Architectural Overview

CERM distinguishes four logical layers:

1. Canonical Data Layer  
2. Canonical Disclosure Intent Layer (CDI)  
3. Interpretation & Mapping Layer (CMP)  
4. Disclosure & Presentation Layer  

Each layer has a single responsibility.

Layers interact only through documented interfaces.  
No layer is permitted to redefine the responsibility of another.

This separation prevents semantic drift and regulatory entanglement within core data structures.

---

## 3. Canonical Data Layer

### 3.1 Purpose

The Canonical Data Layer models sustainability information as structured organisational assertions.

It represents:

- Activities and operational sources  
- Measured metrics and calculated values  
- Targets, baselines, and trajectories  
- Organisational and reporting boundaries  
- Evidence and methodological provenance  

This layer is framework-agnostic and disclosure-agnostic.

It defines structured representations of organisational data — not regulatory obligations.

---

### 3.2 Characteristics

The Canonical Data Layer:

- Contains no references to reporting standards  
- Contains no compliance logic  
- Supports both measured and derived values  
- Is versioned independently of disclosure frameworks  
- Preserves historical reconstruction  

Values modelled in this layer represent structured assertions of organisational state at a given time.

They are not communication decisions.

---

### 3.3 Outputs

The layer exposes canonical data elements such as:

- Absolute metrics (e.g. emissions)  
- Intensity metrics  
- Targets and reduction trajectories  
- Progress indicators  
- Methodological descriptors  

Higher layers may consume these elements.

They may not alter them.

---

## 4. Canonical Disclosure Intent Layer (CDI)

### 4.1 Purpose

The Canonical Disclosure Intent (CDI) layer defines stable semantic disclosure concepts independent of any specific framework structure.

A disclosure intent represents what an organisation intends to communicate externally as a durable reporting concept.

Examples include:

- Gross Scope 1 emissions  
- Existence of a climate transition plan  
- Progress against emissions reduction targets  

Disclosure intents define meaning, not formatting and not compliance triggers.

---

### 4.2 Architectural Role

The CDI layer:

- Bridges structured data and external communication  
- Prevents duplication of semantic meaning across frameworks  
- Anchors reporting concepts to stable definitions  

Each disclosure intent:

- References one or more canonical data elements  
- Declares boundary and temporal applicability  
- Does not perform calculations  
- Does not encode regulatory thresholds  
- Does not assert compliance  

CDIs are semantic anchors.

They do not interpret law.

---

### 4.3 Stability

Disclosure intents are designed to remain stable across regulatory cycles.

Frameworks may evolve.  
Jurisdictions may introduce new obligations.

The semantic meaning of disclosure concepts should not fluctuate with those changes.

Stability supports:

- Long-term reuse  
- Consistent assurance  
- Reduced interpretive divergence  
- Regulatory resilience  

---

## 5. Interpretation & Mapping Layer (CMP)

### 5.1 Purpose

The Interpretation & Mapping Layer documents how specific reporting standards and jurisdictions interpret disclosure intents.

This layer is implemented through Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

CMPs:

- Map framework requirements to CDIs  
- Document interpretive assumptions  
- Specify scope conditions  
- Preserve professional judgement explicitly  

CMPs describe how standards consume disclosure meaning.

They do not redefine that meaning.

---

### 5.2 Non-Authoritative Positioning

CMPs are:

- Non-normative  
- Non-authoritative  
- Explicit about interpretive choices  

They do not:

- Declare compliance  
- Certify reporting adequacy  
- Replace auditor judgement  

Authority remains with:

- Standards bodies  
- Regulators  
- Auditors  
- Reporting entities  

The mapping layer models interpretation without asserting it.

---

### 5.3 Independent Evolution

CMPs evolve independently from:

- The CERM data layer  
- The CDI semantic layer  

This allows regulatory updates to be incorporated without destabilising foundational semantic structures.

Interpretation may change.

Meaning does not.

---

## 6. Disclosure & Presentation Layer

### 6.1 Purpose

The Disclosure & Presentation Layer renders outputs required for:

- Regulatory filings  
- Sustainability reports  
- Questionnaires  
- Digital submissions  

This layer sits outside the core scope of CERM.

---

### 6.2 Characteristics

The presentation layer may:

- Reformat data per framework  
- Apply materiality filters  
- Include narrative context  
- Use jurisdiction-specific templates  

CERM does not constrain presentation, provided upstream semantic contracts are preserved.

---

## 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 7.1 Versioning

Each architectural layer:

- Is versioned independently  
- References specific versions of adjacent layers  
- Preserves immutable historical states  

This enables reconstruction of:

- Reported values  
- Applicable definitions  
- Interpretive mappings  

Version discipline is integral to audit integrity.

---

### 7.2 Traceability

Traceability is preserved through:

- Stable identifiers  
- Explicit inter-layer references  
- Immutable version identifiers  

Any disclosed figure can be traced back to:

- Canonical data elements  
- Disclosure intent definitions  
- Mapping rationale  

Traceability is structural, not procedural.

---

### 7.3 Extensibility

Extensions may be introduced at:

- The data layer (new metrics)  
- The CDI layer (new disclosure intents)  
- The mapping layer (new frameworks or jurisdictions)  

Extensions must not redefine canonical elements.

They may add or specialise.

They may not alter established semantic meaning.

---

## 8. Architectural Non-Goals

CERM does not attempt to:

- Enforce regulatory compliance  
- Replace sustainability standards  
- Automate materiality judgement  
- Prescribe enterprise system architecture  
- Certify reporting outputs  

Its purpose is structural coherence and semantic discipline.

Operational governance remains external.

---

## 9. Summary

The CERM architecture establishes a disciplined separation between:

- Structured organisational assertions (data)  
- Durable disclosure meaning (intent)  
- Framework interpretation (mapping)  
- External communication (presentation)  

This separation enables organisations to model sustainability information once and reuse it across evolving global reporting regimes without semantic distortion.

CERM is infrastructure.

It is not authority.
