# Reference Model

## 1. Purpose of the Reference Model

This section defines the canonical element types that constitute the Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM).

The reference model specifies:

- The recognised structural element types  
- Their semantic role and constraints  
- The permitted relationships between them  

It does not prescribe:

- Calculation formulas  
- Reporting thresholds  
- Materiality determinations  
- Compliance interpretations  
- Regulatory acceptance  

The reference model is designed to be stable, extensible, and implementation-agnostic.

Its purpose is structural coherence, not regulatory authority.

---

## 2. Core Element Types

CERM defines the following canonical element types:

- Entity  
- Activity  
- Metric  
- Metric Identifier  
- Boundary  
- Geospatial Boundary  
- Time Period  
- Target  
- Trajectory  
- Methodology  
- Evidence  
- Assurance  
- Assertion  

Each element type has a single responsibility.

Each element is referenced through stable identifiers.

Each element may be versioned when its definition changes.

---

## 3. Entity

### 3.1 Definition

An Entity represents an organisational unit about which sustainability assertions are made.

Examples include:

- A legal entity  
- A reporting group  
- A business unit  
- A facility or asset  

### 3.2 Characteristics

An Entity:

- Has a stable identifier  
- May participate in one or more boundaries  
- May reference geospatial boundaries  
- May perform activities  
- Is defined independently of accounting or regulatory consolidation rules  

Entities represent organisational structure.

They do not encode reporting scope decisions.

---

## 4. Activity

### 4.1 Definition

An Activity represents a real-world process, operation, or behaviour that may give rise to sustainability-related outcomes.

Examples include:

- Fuel combustion  
- Electricity consumption  
- Material production  
- Transportation  
- Procurement  

### 4.2 Characteristics

An Activity:

- Occurs within a defined time period  
- Is associated with one or more entities  
- May generate one or more metrics  
- May reference a methodology  
- May reference geospatial boundaries  

Activities describe operational behaviour.

They do not describe disclosure format.

---

## 5. Metric

### 5.1 Definition

A Metric represents a quantitative measurement or calculated value associated with sustainability performance.

Examples include:

- Greenhouse gas emissions  
- Energy consumption  
- Emissions intensity  
- Water withdrawal  

### 5.2 Characteristics

A Metric:

- Has a defined unit of measure  
- Applies to a specific time period  
- Is associated with a boundary  
- May be measured or derived  
- May reference a methodology  
- May reference one or more Metric Identifiers  

Metrics represent structured quantitative assertions.

They are not disclosures and do not imply compliance.

---

## 6. Metric Identifier

### 6.1 Definition

A Metric Identifier represents a structured or machine-readable tag associated with a metric for interoperability or digital reporting purposes.

Examples include:

- XBRL concept identifiers  
- Regulatory taxonomy tags  
- Internal canonical identifiers  

### 6.2 Characteristics

A Metric Identifier:

- References a specific metric  
- May reference an external taxonomy  
- Does not modify the semantic meaning of the metric  
- Exists solely to enable digital interoperability  

Identifiers support structured exchange without embedding framework semantics into CERM.

---

## 7. Boundary

### 7.1 Definition

A Boundary defines the organisational, operational, or value-chain scope within which activities and metrics are included.

Examples include:

- Operational control  
- Financial control  
- Equity share  
- Upstream value chain  
- Downstream value chain  

### 7.2 Characteristics

A Boundary:

- Is explicitly defined and uniquely identifiable  
- May apply to entities, activities, or metrics  
- May change over time and therefore be versioned  
- Does not imply regulatory acceptability  

Boundaries make scope assumptions explicit and reviewable.

---

## 8. Geospatial Boundary

### 8.1 Definition

A Geospatial Boundary represents the physical or geographic scope associated with an entity, activity, or metric.

Examples include:

- Facility coordinates  
- Country or regional classification  
- Protected area designation  

### 8.2 Characteristics

A Geospatial Boundary:

- Supplements organisational or operational boundaries  
- May reference recognised spatial identifiers  
- Does not encode regulatory classification  
- Enables location-based modelling  

Geospatial boundaries clarify spatial assumptions.

---

## 9. Time Period

### 9.1 Definition

A Time Period represents the temporal interval to which an assertion applies.

Examples include:

- A fiscal year  
- A calendar year  
- A reporting quarter  
- A baseline year  

### 9.2 Characteristics

A Time Period:

- Has defined start and end points  
- May support historical or forward-looking assertions  
- May function as baseline or target reference  

Explicit temporal definition prevents ambiguity.

---

## 10. Target

### 10.1 Definition

A Target represents an intended future outcome associated with sustainability performance.

Examples include:

- Emissions reduction targets  
- Energy efficiency targets  
- Renewable energy adoption targets  

### 10.2 Characteristics

A Target:

- References one or more metrics  
- Specifies a baseline time period  
- Specifies one or more future time periods  
- Does not assert achievement  

Targets represent declared intent.

They do not represent realised performance.

---

## 11. Trajectory

### 11.1 Definition

A Trajectory represents a planned or modelled pathway between a baseline and a target.

Examples include:

- Linear reduction pathways  
- Scenario-aligned pathways  
- Internally defined planning pathways  

### 11.2 Characteristics

A Trajectory:

- Is associated with a target  
- May reference external scenarios or methodologies  
- Is descriptive rather than normative  

Trajectories enable structured progress modelling without prescribing ambition.

---

## 12. Methodology

### 12.1 Definition

A Methodology describes the approach used to measure, calculate, or estimate a metric or trajectory.

Examples include:

- Calculation standards  
- Estimation techniques  
- Allocation rules  

### 12.2 Characteristics

A Methodology:

- Is referenced, not embedded  
- May evolve independently of metrics  
- May reference external sources  
- Does not determine regulatory sufficiency  

Methodologies provide transparency while preserving implementation flexibility.

---

## 13. Evidence

### 13.1 Definition

Evidence represents supporting artefacts used to substantiate assertions.

Examples include:

- Invoices  
- Meter readings  
- Contracts  
- System logs  
- Policy documents  

### 13.2 Characteristics

Evidence:

- Is linked to assertions or metrics  
- Is not stored within CERM  
- Supports verification and assurance processes  

CERM defines evidence relationships, not storage mechanisms.

---

## 14. Assurance

### 14.1 Definition

An Assurance element represents an independent evaluation of one or more assertions.

Examples include:

- Limited assurance  
- Reasonable assurance  
- Third-party verification statements  

### 14.2 Characteristics

An Assurance:

- References specific assertions  
- Specifies scope and time period  
- May reference an assurance provider  
- May specify assurance level  
- Does not determine regulatory compliance  

Assurance enhances transparency without embedding legal authority.

---

## 15. Assertion

### 15.1 Definition

An Assertion represents a declared claim about sustainability performance or state at a defined time and within a defined boundary.

Assertions may be:

- Quantitative (e.g., a metric value)  
- Qualitative (e.g., existence of a policy)  
- Forward-looking (e.g., a target)  

### 15.2 Characteristics

An Assertion:

- References one or more canonical elements  
- Is bound by time period and boundary  
- May reference assurance  
- Is immutable once issued  

Assertions are the atomic units of auditability within CERM.

They represent declared organisational claims, not regulatory determinations.

---

## 16. Relationships Between Elements

CERM defines explicit directional relationships, including:

- Entities perform Activities  
- Activities generate Metrics  
- Metrics may reference Metric Identifiers  
- Metrics apply within Boundaries  
- Entities, Activities, or Metrics may reference Geospatial Boundaries  
- Metrics occur during Time Periods  
- Targets reference Metrics  
- Trajectories support Targets  
- Methodologies govern Metrics and Trajectories  
- Evidence supports Assertions  
- Assurance evaluates Assertions  
- Assertions declare values or states  

All relationships are explicit and versioned.

Implicit dependencies are not permitted.

---

## 17. Versioning and Identity

Each canonical element:

- Has a stable identifier  
- Is versioned when definitions change  
- May be superseded but not deleted  

Historical versions remain referenceable to preserve audit integrity and longitudinal comparability.

---

## 18. Non-Goals of the Reference Model

The reference model does not:

- Embed reporting framework semantics  
- Encode compliance logic  
- Perform calculations  
- Validate correctness of data  
- Interpret regulatory acceptability  

These concerns are intentionally addressed in higher architectural layers.

---

## 19. Summary

The CERM reference model defines a minimal but complete set of canonical element types required to model sustainability performance in a structured, traceable, and reusable manner.

By separating:

- Organisational structure  
- Operational activity  
- Quantitative measurement  
- Scope definition  
- Methodology  
- Intent  
- Assurance  
- Disclosure interpretation  

CERM enables durable interoperability across evolving reporting ecosystems.

CERM defines structure.

It does not define compliance.
