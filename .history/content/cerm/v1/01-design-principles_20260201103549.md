# Design Principles

## 1. Purpose

The Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM) provides a vendor-neutral, interoperable reference architecture for sustainability reporting systems. This document establishes the foundational principles governing CERM's design, evolution, and application.

## 2. Neutrality

CERM shall remain independent of:
- Individual software vendors or platforms
- Specific jurisdictional requirements
- Proprietary data formats or exchange protocols
- Commercial certification schemes

Neutrality ensures the model serves as common ground for all implementers, regardless of organizational affiliation or regulatory environment.

## 3. Interoperability

CERM prioritizes machine-readable structures that enable:
- Data exchange between heterogeneous systems
- Transformation across reporting frameworks without information loss
- Integration with existing enterprise architectures
- Long-term preservation of reported data

Interoperability is achieved through explicit data typing, unambiguous identifiers, and documented transformation pathways.

## 4. Auditability

All structural elements within CERM must support:
- Complete lineage from source assertion to reported value
- Versioning of definitions and relationships
- Reproducible derivation of computed values
- Immutable reference to external standards

Auditability requires that any compliant implementation can demonstrate how reported figures were derived and what definitions governed their calculation.

## 5. Reuse

CERM designs for reuse at multiple levels:
- **Conceptual reuse**: Core definitions applicable across sectors and jurisdictions
- **Structural reuse**: Common patterns for organizing and relating disclosures
- **Technical reuse**: Standardized representations enabling shared tooling

Reuse minimizes duplication of effort and reduces divergence in interpretation.

## 6. Stability

Versioned releases of CERM guarantee:
- Backward compatibility within major versions
- Clear deprecation pathways for obsolete elements
- Documented migration strategies between versions
- Immutable references to specific version identifiers

Stability enables long-term planning and reduces upgrade friction for implementers.

## 7. Extensibility

CERM provides explicit extension points allowing:
- Sector-specific additions without core model modification
- Jurisdictional overlays for localized requirements
- Proprietary extensions clearly segregated from canonical elements

Extensions must not redefine or contradict canonical elements; they may only add new structures or specialize existing ones within documented constraints.

## 8. Transparency

All aspects of CERM development and maintenance are:
- Documented in publicly accessible repositories
- Subject to documented change control procedures
- Available for review and comment by interested parties
- Licensed under terms permitting unrestricted use and adaptation

Transparency ensures the model evolves through collective insight rather than unilateral decision.

## 9. Non-Assertion

CERM makes no claim to:
- Regulatory authority in any jurisdiction
- Endorsement by standards-setting bodies
- Compatibility with specific compliance regimes
- Fitness for any particular purpose beyond documented scope

Implementers are responsible for determining CERM's applicability to their specific requirements and regulatory obligations.

## 10. Governance

Changes to these design principles require:
- Explicit documentation of rationale
- Public comment period of not less than 30 days
- Alignment with stated neutrality and interoperability objectives
- Version increment indicating scope of change

Principles may be amended but shall not be abandoned without successor principles ensuring equivalent neutrality, interoperability, auditability, and reuse.
