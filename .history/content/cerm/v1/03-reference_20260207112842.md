Reference Model
1. Purpose of the Reference Model

This section defines the canonical elements that constitute the Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM).

The reference model specifies:

the types of elements recognised by CERM,

their semantic meaning,

their relationships and constraints.

It does not prescribe:

calculation formulas,

reporting thresholds,

materiality decisions,

compliance interpretations.

The reference model is intended to be stable, extensible, and implementation-agnostic.

2. Core Element Types

CERM defines the following core element types:

Entity

Activity

Metric

Metric Identifier

Boundary

Geospatial Boundary

Time Period

Target

Trajectory

Methodology

Evidence

Assurance

Assertion

Each element type has a single responsibility and may be referenced by other elements through stable identifiers.

3. Entity
3.1 Definition

An Entity represents an organisational unit for which sustainability information is asserted.

Examples include:

a legal entity,

a reporting group,

a business unit,

a facility or asset.

3.2 Characteristics

An Entity:

has a unique identifier,

may participate in one or more boundaries,

may reference geospatial boundaries,

may perform activities,

is not tied to a specific legal or accounting framework.

Entities are defined independently of reporting scope or consolidation logic.

4. Activity
4.1 Definition

An Activity represents a real-world process, operation, or behaviour that may give rise to sustainability impacts.

Examples include:

fuel combustion,

electricity consumption,

material production,

transportation,

procurement.

4.2 Characteristics

An Activity:

occurs within a time period,

is associated with one or more entities,

may generate one or more metrics,

may reference a methodology,

may reference geospatial boundaries.

Activities describe what happens, not how it is reported.

5. Metric
5.1 Definition

A Metric represents a quantitative measurement or calculated value related to sustainability performance.

Examples include:

greenhouse gas emissions,

energy consumption,

emissions intensity,

water withdrawal.

5.2 Characteristics

A Metric:

has a defined unit of measure,

applies to a specific time period,

is associated with a boundary,

may be measured or derived,

may reference a methodology,

may reference one or more Metric Identifiers.

Metrics are facts or computed assertions, not disclosures.

6. Metric Identifier
6.1 Definition

A Metric Identifier represents a structured or machine-readable identifier assigned to a metric for digital reporting or taxonomy alignment purposes.

Examples include:

XBRL concept identifiers,

regulatory taxonomy tags,

internal canonical codes.

6.2 Characteristics

A Metric Identifier:

references a specific metric,

may reference an external reporting taxonomy,

does not alter the semantic meaning of the metric,

enables interoperability and digital tagging.

Metric Identifiers support structured reporting without embedding framework semantics in CERM.

7. Boundary
7.1 Definition

A Boundary defines the organisational, operational, or value-chain scope within which activities and metrics are included.

Examples include:

operational control,

financial control,

equity share,

upstream or downstream value-chain scope.

7.2 Characteristics

A Boundary:

is explicitly defined and identifiable,

may apply to entities, activities, or metrics,

may change over time and therefore be versioned,

does not imply regulatory acceptability.

Boundaries ensure scope assumptions are explicit rather than implicit.

8. Geospatial Boundary
8.1 Definition

A Geospatial Boundary represents the physical or geographic scope associated with an entity, activity, or metric.

Examples include:

facility coordinates,

protected or sensitive area classification,

country or regional designation.

8.2 Characteristics

A Geospatial Boundary:

may supplement organisational or operational boundaries,

may reference spatial identifiers or classifications,

does not imply regulatory interpretation,

supports location-based disclosures.

Geospatial boundaries ensure spatial assumptions are explicit.

9. Time Period
9.1 Definition

A Time Period represents the temporal interval to which an assertion applies.

Examples include:

a fiscal year,

a calendar year,

a reporting quarter,

a baseline year.

9.2 Characteristics

A Time Period:

has a defined start and end,

may be used for historical or forward-looking assertions,

may serve as a baseline or target reference.

Time Periods are explicit to prevent temporal ambiguity.

10. Target
10.1 Definition

A Target represents an intended future outcome related to sustainability performance.

Examples include:

emissions reduction targets,

energy efficiency targets,

renewable energy adoption targets.

10.2 Characteristics

A Target:

references one or more metrics,

specifies a baseline time period,

specifies one or more target time periods,

does not assert achievement.

Targets describe intent, not outcome.

11. Trajectory
11.1 Definition

A Trajectory represents a planned or expected pathway between a baseline and a target.

Examples include:

linear reduction pathways,

science-based pathways,

internally defined pathways.

11.2 Characteristics

A Trajectory:

is associated with a target,

may reference external scenarios or methodologies,

is descriptive, not normative.

Trajectories enable progress assessment without prescribing ambition.

12. Methodology
12.1 Definition

A Methodology describes the approach used to measure, calculate, or estimate a metric or trajectory.

Examples include:

calculation standards,

estimation techniques,

allocation rules.

12.2 Characteristics

A Methodology:

is referenced, not embedded,

may evolve independently of metrics,

may reference external sources.

Methodologies provide transparency without locking implementations.

13. Evidence
13.1 Definition

Evidence represents supporting artefacts used to substantiate assertions.

Examples include:

invoices,

meter readings,

contracts,

system logs,

policy documents.

13.2 Characteristics

Evidence:

is linked to assertions or metrics,

is not stored within CERM,

supports verification and assurance processes.

CERM defines relationships to evidence, not evidence storage.

14. Assurance
14.1 Definition

An Assurance element represents an independent evaluation of an assertion or group of assertions.

Examples include:

limited assurance,

reasonable assurance,

third-party verification statements.

14.2 Characteristics

An Assurance:

references one or more assertions,

specifies scope and time period,

may reference an assurance provider,

may specify assurance level,

does not determine regulatory compliance.

Assurance enhances auditability without embedding regulatory logic.

15. Assertion
15.1 Definition

An Assertion represents a claim made about sustainability performance at a specific point in time.

Assertions may be:

quantitative (e.g. a metric value),

qualitative (e.g. existence of a policy),

forward-looking (e.g. a target).

15.2 Characteristics

An Assertion:

references one or more canonical elements,

is bound by time and boundary,

may reference assurance,

is immutable once issued.

Assertions are the atomic units of auditability.

16. Relationships Between Elements

CERM defines explicit relationships, including:

Entities perform Activities

Activities generate Metrics

Metrics may reference Metric Identifiers

Metrics apply within Boundaries

Entities / Activities / Metrics may reference Geospatial Boundaries

Metrics occur during Time Periods

Targets reference Metrics

Trajectories support Targets

Methodologies govern Metrics and Trajectories

Evidence supports Assertions

Assurance evaluates Assertions

Assertions declare values or states

All relationships are directional and explicitly documented.

17. Versioning and Identity

Each canonical element:

has a stable identifier,

is versioned when definitions change,

may be superseded but not deleted.

Historical versions remain referenceable to preserve audit trails.

18. Non-Goals of the Reference Model

The reference model does not:

embed reporting framework semantics,

encode compliance logic,

perform calculations,

validate correctness of data.

These concerns are intentionally delegated to higher architectural layers.

19. Summary

The CERM reference model establishes a minimal but complete set of canonical elements required to describe sustainability performance in a structured, auditable, and reusable manner.

By separating facts, intent, methodology, disclosure, location, digital tagging, and assurance, the model enables long-term interoperability across evolving reporting landscapes.
