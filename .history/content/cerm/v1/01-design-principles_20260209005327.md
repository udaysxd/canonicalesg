# Design Principles

## 1. Purpose

The Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM) establishes a vendor-neutral, framework-independent reference architecture for modelling sustainability data.

CERM defines structural and semantic conventions for organising sustainability information in a durable and interoperable manner. It does not prescribe policy positions, materiality judgements, regulatory interpretations, or compliance determinations.

Its purpose is infrastructural: to provide stable modelling foundations beneath evolving disclosure regimes.

---

## 2. Structural Neutrality

CERM shall remain independent of:

- Individual software vendors or technology platforms  
- Specific regulatory jurisdictions  
- Proprietary data formats or exchange protocols  
- Commercial certification or assurance schemes  

CERM does not embed framework logic or regulatory obligation within its core structures.

Neutrality ensures the model functions as common structural ground across standards, jurisdictions, and implementation environments.

---

## 3. Interoperability

CERM prioritises machine-readable and semantically explicit structures that enable:

- Data exchange between heterogeneous systems  
- Transformation across reporting frameworks without semantic distortion  
- Integration with enterprise data architectures  
- Long-term preservation of reported information  

Interoperability is achieved through:

- Explicit data typing  
- Stable identifiers  
- Version-controlled definitions  
- Documented transformation pathways  

Information modelled under CERM must remain intelligible to both machines and human reviewers across time.

---

## 4. Auditability and Traceability

All structural elements within CERM must support:

- Lineage from source assertion to reported value  
- Versioning of definitions and relationships  
- Reproducible derivation of computed values  
- Stable, citable references to external methodologies  

Any compliant implementation should be capable of demonstrating:

- How reported figures were derived  
- Which definitions governed their calculation  
- Which version of the model applied at the time of reporting  

Auditability is a structural requirement, not an optional feature.

---

## 5. Reuse

CERM is designed for reuse at multiple levels:

- **Conceptual reuse** — Core definitions applicable across sectors and jurisdictions  
- **Structural reuse** — Common modelling patterns for organising disclosures  
- **Technical reuse** — Standardised representations enabling shared tooling  

Reuse reduces duplication of modelling effort and limits interpretive divergence across frameworks.

---

## 6. Stability and Version Discipline

Versioned releases of CERM provide:

- Backward compatibility within major versions  
- Explicit semantic version identifiers  
- Documented deprecation pathways  
- Immutable references to published versions  

Frozen versions are not modified.

Where breaking changes are necessary, they are introduced only through major version increments and accompanied by migration guidance.

Stability is treated as a foundational property of the architecture.

---

## 7. Extensibility

CERM provides explicit extension mechanisms enabling:

- Sector-specific additions  
- Jurisdictional overlays  
- Organisational or proprietary extensions  

Extensions must:

- Remain structurally segregated from canonical elements  
- Avoid redefining or contradicting canonical definitions  
- Preserve semantic integrity  

Extensions may add or specialise; they may not alter canonical meaning.

---

## 8. Transparency

All CERM development activities are:

- Publicly documented  
- Subject to documented change control  
- Versioned and archived  
- Licensed for unrestricted use and adaptation  

Transparency supports collective scrutiny and long-term trust.

---

## 9. Non-Assertion and Scope Boundaries

CERM makes no claim to:

- Regulatory authority in any jurisdiction  
- Endorsement by standards-setting bodies  
- Normative interpretation of disclosure requirements  
- Automatic compliance with any reporting regime  

CERM defines structural modelling conventions only.

Applicability to regulatory or reporting contexts remains the responsibility of implementers.

---

## 10. Governance of Principles

Amendments to these design principles require:

- Explicit documentation of rationale  
- Public notice and comment  
- Alignment with neutrality, interoperability, and stability objectives  
- A version increment reflecting scope of change  

CERM shall be maintained by a designated steward operating under these principles.

If amended, successor principles must preserve equivalent commitments to neutrality, structural integrity, interoperability, auditability, and stability.
