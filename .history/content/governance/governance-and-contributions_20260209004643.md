# Governance and Contribution Model

## Purpose

This document defines how Canonical ESG is stewarded, how the architecture evolves, and how contributions are proposed, reviewed, and incorporated.

Canonical ESG is a reference infrastructure initiative.  
It is not a standards-setting body, regulator, or certification authority.

The governance model exists to preserve:

- Semantic integrity  
- Structural coherence  
- Version stability  
- Neutral positioning  
- Transparent evolution  

---

## Governance Orientation

Canonical ESG governance is infrastructural rather than normative.

It does not:

- Define compliance requirements  
- Issue interpretive rulings  
- Endorse reporting positions  
- Confer regulatory authority  

It maintains the structural architecture beneath disclosure regimes.

---

## Core Governance Principles

Governance decisions are guided by the following principles:

### 1. Neutrality
No framework, jurisdiction, vendor, consulting methodology, or organisation has privileged status within the architecture.

### 2. Semantic Stability
Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) are designed to remain durable across regulatory cycles.  
Changes that alter meaning are treated with exceptional caution.

### 3. Explicit Interpretation Separation
Framework and jurisdictional logic must remain distinct from semantic meaning.  
Regulatory interpretation must not redefine disclosure concepts.

### 4. Transparency
All accepted changes are versioned, documented, and publicly traceable.

### 5. Non-Assertion
Governance does not assert interpretive authority over external standards.

### 6. Institutional Viability
The model is designed to support future multi-stakeholder stewardship while preserving architectural discipline.

## Stewardship and Maintainer Responsibilities

Canonical ESG is currently stewarded during its infrastructure phase.

The maintainer is responsible for:

- Curating and publishing official versions  
- Managing version control and changelogs  
- Preserving coherence across CDI, CMP, and jurisdiction layers  
- Maintaining documentation and registries  
- Evaluating contribution proposals against governance principles  

The maintainer does not:

- Certify implementations  
- Approve compliance claims  
- Provide regulatory interpretation  
- Endorse advisory methodologies  

Stewardship is custodial, not proprietary.

---

## Types of Contributions

Contributions may include:

- Clarifications to documentation  
- Proposals for new Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs)  
- Proposals for new Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs)  
- Jurisdictional mapping proposals  
- Corrections of structural inconsistencies  
- Schema and tooling improvements  

All contributions are non-binding until formally accepted and published.

---

## Contribution Process

Contributions follow a structured lifecycle.

### 1. Proposal

A contributor submits a written proposal describing:

- The proposed change or addition  
- The rationale  
- Affected architectural layers  
- Compatibility implications  
- Any impact on existing versions  

### 2. Architectural Review

Proposals are evaluated for:

- Alignment with governance principles  
- Impact on semantic stability  
- Preservation of neutrality  
- Version compatibility considerations  
- Avoidance of regulatory overreach  

### 3. Decision

The maintainer may:

- Accept  
- Request revision  
- Defer pending further analysis  
- Reject with documented reasoning  

Decisions are documented to preserve transparency.

### 4. Publication

Accepted changes are:

- Assigned a version designation  
- Documented in the changelog  
- Published with explicit status (e.g., draft, active, frozen)  

---

## Versioning and Stability Model

Canonical ESG uses explicit semantic versioning.

- **Major versions** introduce structural architectural changes.
- **Minor versions** introduce additive extensions or refinements.
- **Patch versions** correct errors without altering semantic meaning.

Frozen versions are immutable and remain referenceable.

No published version is retroactively modified.

---

## Relationship to External Standards

Canonical ESG does not modify, reinterpret, override, or restate external standards.

Framework texts remain authoritative within their respective domains.

Contributions referencing external standards must:

- Accurately cite requirements  
- Avoid normative restatement  
- Explicitly distinguish interpretation from source text  

Canonical ESG models structural relationships.  
It does not define regulatory obligations.

---

## Conflict of Interest

Contributors are expected to disclose material conflicts of interest when submitting proposals.

The maintainer may decline proposals that:

- Introduce vendor-specific advantage  
- Privilege a single framework or jurisdiction  
- Undermine neutrality  
- Embed commercial positioning into the architecture  

Governance decisions prioritise structural integrity over expediency.

---

## Licensing

Canonical ESG artefacts are published under an open license.

By submitting a contribution, contributors acknowledge that:

- Accepted contributions may be redistributed  
- Accepted contributions may be adapted in future versions  
- No contributor retains exclusive control over accepted material  

---

## Governance Evolution

This governance model reflects the current infrastructure phase.

As participation grows, governance may evolve toward:

- Structured multi-stakeholder review  
- Advisory participation mechanisms  
- Formalised stewardship arrangements  

Any governance changes will:

- Be versioned  
- Be publicly documented  
- Preserve architectural neutrality  

---

## Summary

Canonical ESG governance exists to protect semantic integrity while enabling transparent evolution.

It is designed to support an ecosystem.

It does not seek to control one.
