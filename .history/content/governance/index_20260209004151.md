# Governance

Canonical ESG governance defines how the architecture is maintained, how it evolves, and how contributions are evaluated and incorporated.

Governance exists to preserve:

- Semantic stability  
- Structural coherence  
- Version discipline  
- Non-authoritative positioning  
- Long-term institutional integrity  

Canonical ESG is infrastructure.  
Its governance model reflects that orientation.

## Governance Principles

The project is guided by the following principles:

**1. Semantic Stability**  
Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) are designed to remain durable over time.  
Changes are carefully controlled to prevent semantic drift.

**2. Explicit Interpretation Layers**  
Framework and jurisdictional interpretations are modelled transparently.  
Regulatory logic does not alter semantic meaning.

**3. Version Discipline**  
Changes are versioned, documented, and traceable.  
Backward compatibility and migration clarity are prioritised.

**4. Non-Authoritative Positioning**  
Canonical ESG does not define compliance.  
It models structure beneath standards and regulation.

**5. Institutional Viability**  
The governance model is designed to support future multi-stakeholder stewardship.

## Governance Documents

- [Governance and Contribution Model](/governance/governance-and-contributions)  
  Describes decision-making structure, stewardship responsibilities, and contribution processes.

- [How Canonical ESG Evolves](/governance/how-canonical-esg-evolves)  
  Explains the change lifecycle, versioning approach, and stability guarantees.

Governance at this stage is infrastructural rather than institutional.

As participation expands, Canonical ESG is designed to transition toward broader, structured, multi-stakeholder stewardship while preserving its semantic integrity.
