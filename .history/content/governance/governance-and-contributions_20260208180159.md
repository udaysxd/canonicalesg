# Governance and Contribution Model

## Purpose

This document describes how Canonical ESG is governed and how contributions are proposed, reviewed, and incorporated.

The governance model is designed to:
- preserve neutrality and non-authoritativeness,
- enable transparent evolution of the model,
- avoid centralisation of interpretive authority,
- remain lightweight and practical.

Canonical ESG is a reference model, not a standards body.

---

## Governance Principles

Canonical ESG governance is guided by the following principles:

- **Neutrality**: No single framework, jurisdiction, vendor, or organisation has privileged status.
- **Transparency**: Changes, rationales, and version history are publicly documented.
- **Stability**: Published versions are stable and referenceable.
- **Non-Assertion**: Governance does not confer regulatory or interpretive authority.
- **Practicality**: Processes are designed to be lightweight and sustainable.

---

## Maintainer Role

Canonical ESG is currently maintained by the Canonical ESG project.

The maintainer is responsible for:
- curating and publishing official versions,
- managing versioning and change logs,
- ensuring consistency across CERM, CDI, and CMP artefacts,
- maintaining public documentation and registries.

The maintainer does not:
- certify implementations,
- endorse interpretations,
- assert compliance with any framework.

---

## Contribution Types

Contributions to Canonical ESG may include:

- clarification of existing documentation,
- proposals for new disclosure intents (CDI),
- proposals for new Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP),
- corrections of errors or inconsistencies,
- tooling or schema improvements.

All contributions are considered non-binding until accepted and published by the maintainer.

---

## Contribution Process

Contributions follow a documented process:

1. **Proposal**  
   A contributor submits a written proposal describing:
   - the change or addition,
   - the rationale,
   - the affected components,
   - any compatibility considerations.

2. **Review**  
   The proposal is reviewed for:
   - alignment with design principles,
   - impact on existing versions,
   - neutrality and scope.

3. **Decision**  
   The maintainer may:
   - accept the proposal,
   - request clarification or revision,
   - defer the proposal,
   - reject the proposal with explanation.

4. **Publication**  
   Accepted changes are:
   - versioned,
   - documented in changelogs,
   - published with appropriate status (draft, frozen).

---

## Versioning and Stability

Canonical ESG uses explicit versioning.

- Major versions introduce structural changes.
- Minor versions introduce extensions or refinements.
- Patch versions correct errors without changing meaning.

Frozen versions are immutable and remain referenceable.

---

## Relationship to External Standards

Canonical ESG does not modify, reinterpret, or override external standards.

Framework texts remain authoritative.

Contributions must:
- reference external standards accurately,
- avoid restating normative requirements,
- document interpretation choices explicitly.

---

## Conflict of Interest

Contributors are expected to disclose material conflicts of interest when proposing changes.

The maintainer may decline contributions that:
- introduce vendor-specific bias,
- privilege a single framework,
- undermine neutrality.

---

## Licensing and Use

Canonical ESG documentation and artefacts are published under an open license.

Contributions are accepted on the basis that:
- they may be redistributed,
- they may be adapted,
- they may be incorporated into future versions.

No contributor retains exclusive control over accepted contributions.

---

## Future Governance Evolution

This governance model is intentionally minimal.

As adoption grows, governance may evolve to include:
- advisory groups,
- community review processes,
- formal stewardship arrangements.

Any governance changes will be documented and versioned.

---

## Summary

Canonical ESG governance prioritises neutrality, transparency, and stability over authority or enforcement.

It exists to support an ecosystem — not to control it.
