# Canonical Mapping Packs — Version 1 (CMP v1)

This section documents **Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) defined under CMP v1**.

CMP v1 provides a stable structure for documenting how **Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1)** are interpreted by specific sustainability reporting frameworks.

CMPs are **non-authoritative**, **framework-referencing** artefacts intended to make interpretation explicit, transparent, and reviewable.

---

## Scope of CMP v1

CMP v1 applies to:

- mappings based on **CDI v1**,
- interpretations of published sustainability reporting frameworks,
- topic-specific and cross-topic mapping packs,
- both human-readable and machine-readable CMP representations.

CMP v1 does not define:
- reporting obligations,
- materiality thresholds,
- calculation rules,
- performance evaluation,
- assurance criteria.

---

## Dependency on Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

All CMPs defined under CMP v1 are explicitly anchored to **Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI v1)**.

CMPs:
- must reference CDI identifiers directly,
- must not redefine CDI semantics,
- document only framework-specific interpretation.

The stability of CDI v1 ensures that CMP v1 artefacts remain comparable and auditable even as reporting frameworks evolve.

## CMP v1 Structure

Each CMP defined under CMP v1 follows a common structure, including:

- CMP metadata and versioning information,
- scope and coverage declaration,
- disclosure intent mappings (CDI → framework),
- interpretation notes and assumptions,
- limitations and known gaps,
- version history and status.

This structure supports transparency, traceability, and reuse.

## Climate Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP v1)

Climate CMPs document interpretations of **climate-related disclosure intents** defined in CDI v1.

Climate CMPs may cover, among other topics:

- climate governance and strategy,
- climate-related risks and opportunities,
- policies and commitments,
- targets and transition planning,
- greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3),
- energy and mitigation actions,
- performance tracking and progress,
- methodologies and assumptions.

Climate CMPs reference Climate CDIs and map them to frameworks such as:
- ESRS E1,
- GRI 305,
- CDP Climate Change questionnaires.

Climate CMPs do not determine:
- whether disclosures are required,
- whether targets are sufficient,
- alignment with climate pathways.

### Available Climate CMPs

- **Climate CMP v0.3 (Frozen)**  
  Near-complete climate disclosure coverage across governance, targets, emissions, and data quality.  
  → [View Climate CMP v0.3](/cmp/v1/examples/climate-cmp-v0.3)

## Energy Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP v1)

Energy CMPs document interpretations of **energy-related disclosure intents** defined in CDI v1.

Energy CMPs may cover, among other topics:

- energy consumption and sources,
- renewable and non-renewable energy use,
- energy procurement and generation,
- energy intensity metrics,
- energy efficiency initiatives,
- energy boundaries and methodologies.

Energy CMPs are **distinct from climate CMPs** and do not address greenhouse gas emissions or climate targets.

Energy CMPs enable transparent interpretation of energy disclosures across sustainability reporting frameworks and energy standards.

### Available Energy CMPs

- **Energy CMP v0.1 (Frozen)**  
  Complete reference implementation covering all Energy disclosure intents defined in CDI v1.  
  → [View Energy CMP v0.1](/cmp/v1/examples/energy-cmp-v0.1)  
  → **Machine-readable (YAML)**: `/cmp/v1/examples/energy-cmp-v0.1.yaml`

---

## CMP v1 Registry

CMP v1 artefacts are discoverable via the **CMP Registry**, which records:

- available CMPs,
- topic domain,
- framework coverage,
- CDI version referenced,
- CMP version and status,
- links to human-readable and machine-readable representations.

→ [View CMP Registry](/cmp/registry)

---

## Status and Versioning

CMP v1 is a **stable major version**.

- New CMPs may be added under CMP v1.
- Existing CMPs may be updated through minor or patch versions.
- Breaking structural changes require a new major CMP version.

Frozen CMPs remain referenceable for historical, comparative, and audit use.

---

## Non-Authority Statement

CMP v1 artefacts:

- are not endorsed by any standards-setting body,
- do not represent official interpretations,
- do not carry regulatory or legal authority.

All use of CMPs requires professional judgement and appropriate contextual consideration.
