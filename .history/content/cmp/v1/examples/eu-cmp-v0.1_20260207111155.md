# European Union Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP v0.1)

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents illustrative interpretations of sustainability disclosure intents under the European Union sustainability reporting framework.

This CMP is non-authoritative and provided for infrastructure-level modelling purposes only.

## Legal Architecture Covered

This CMP reflects the structure of:

- Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)
- European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)

Including:

- ESRS 1 – General requirements
- ESRS 2 – General disclosures
- ESRS E1–E5 (Environmental)
- ESRS S1–S4 (Social)
- ESRS G1 (Governance)

## Regulatory Characteristics

### Double Materiality

EU reporting requires disclosure based on:

- Impact materiality
- Financial materiality

Materiality determination is external to CDI and modelled at CMP interpretation level.

---

### Value Chain Scope

EU disclosures may extend beyond operational boundaries into upstream and downstream value chain activities.

CERM boundaries remain neutral; scope interpretation is CMP-specific.

---

### Assurance

CSRD requires limited assurance initially, with potential progression to reasonable assurance.

Assurance obligations are regulatory, not semantic.

---

### Phasing

Application is phased by:

- Entity size
- Listing status
- Reporting year

Phasing logic is not embedded in CDI.

---

## Domain Coverage

This CMP covers all CDI v1 domains:

- Climate
- Energy
- Water
- Waste
- Biodiversity
- Pollution
- Materials / Circularity
- Workforce
- Governance

---

## Interpretation Principles

- CDI defines semantic meaning only.
- EU law defines disclosure obligation.
- This CMP does not assert compliance.
- Mapping logic reflects ESRS structure at high level.
- Double materiality remains jurisdiction-specific.
- No legal interpretation is provided.

---

## Cross-Domain Observations

- ESRS integrates governance across all environmental and social domains.
- Value chain reporting is structurally broader than many global standards.
- Narrative disclosures are more extensive than in many frameworks.
- EU introduces structured digital tagging requirements (not modelled in CDI).

---

## Limitations

- Sector-specific ESRS standards are not separately mapped.
- EU Taxonomy alignment disclosures are not modelled in this version.
- Digital tagging (XBRL) is not represented.
- Legal interpretation is excluded.
