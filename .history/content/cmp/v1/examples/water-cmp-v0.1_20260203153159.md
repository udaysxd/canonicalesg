## Scope Declaration

This CMP documents illustrative interpretations of **water-related disclosure intents**.

### Topic Scope
- Water-related disclosures (operational water use)
- This CMP is illustrative and non-authoritative.

### Disclosure Intents Covered

- CDI-WATR-01 — Total water withdrawn
- CDI-WATR-02 — Water withdrawal by source type
- CDI-WATR-04 — Total water consumed
- CDI-WATR-06 — Total water discharged
- CDI-WATR-07 — Water discharge by destination
- CDI-WATR-09 — Use of surface water sources
- CDI-WATR-10 — Use of groundwater sources
- CDI-WATR-11 — Use of third-party or municipal water supply
- CDI-WATR-12 — Volume of water reused or recycled
- CDI-WATR-14 — Water intensity metric
- CDI-WATR-19 — Operational dependency on specific water sources
- CDI-WATR-20 — Changes in water use patterns

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E3 (Water and Marine Resources)
- GRI 303 (Water)
- CDP Water Security Questionnaire

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Water is treated as an operational resource.
- No validation of water stress, quality, or stewardship claims.

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

---

### CDI-WATR-01 — Total water withdrawn

**Intent**
Disclose the total volume of water withdrawn by the organisation over the reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water withdrawal (Full)
**GRI**: GRI 303-1 (Full)
**CDP**: Water withdrawal (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Captures aggregate water withdrawal independent of source or consumption.

---

### CDI-WATR-02 — Water withdrawal by source type

**Intent**
Disclose water withdrawn, disaggregated by source type.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water sources (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-1 (Full)
**CDP**: Withdrawal by source (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Source categorisation varies across frameworks.

---

### CDI-WATR-04 — Total water consumed

**Intent**
Disclose the total volume of water consumed by the organisation over the reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water consumption (Full)
**GRI**: GRI 303-3 (Full)
**CDP**: Water consumption (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Represents water not returned to source after use.

---

### CDI-WATR-06 — Total water discharged

**Intent**
Disclose the total volume of water discharged by the organisation over the reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water discharge (Full)
**GRI**: GRI 303-4 (Full)
**CDP**: Water discharge (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Captures water returned to environment or third parties.

---

### CDI-WATR-07 — Water discharge by destination

**Intent**
Disclose water discharged, disaggregated by destination or receiving body.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Discharge destination (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-4 (Full)
**CDP**: Discharge by destination (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**
Destinations may include surface water, groundwater, third-party treatment.

---

### CDI-WATR-09 — Use of surface water sources

**Intent**
Disclose the organisation's use of surface water sources for operational purposes.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Surface water withdrawal (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-1 (Full)
**CDP**: Surface water use (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Requires disaggregation of surface water from other sources.

---

### CDI-WATR-10 — Use of groundwater sources

**Intent**
Disclose the organisation's use of groundwater sources for operational purposes.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Groundwater withdrawal (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-1 (Full)
**CDP**: Groundwater use (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Some frameworks introduce additional contextual considerations alongside groundwater disclosures.


---

### CDI-WATR-11 — Use of third-party or municipal water supply

**Intent**
Disclose the organisation's reliance on water supplied by third parties or municipal systems.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Third-party water (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-1 (Full)
**CDP**: Municipal water use (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Captures purchased or supplied water separate from direct withdrawal.

---

### CDI-WATR-12 — Volume of water reused or recycled

**Intent**
Disclose the volume of water reused or recycled within organisational operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water reuse (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-3 (Contextual)
**CDP**: Water recycling (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**
Framework definitions of reuse and recycling vary.

---

### CDI-WATR-14 — Water intensity metric

**Intent**
Disclose water use normalised by a defined activity, output, or business metric.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water intensity (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303-5 (Full)
**CDP**: Water intensity (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Normalisation approaches differ by sector and framework.

---

### CDI-WATR-19 — Operational dependency on specific water sources

**Intent**
Disclose the organisation's dependency on specific water sources for continued operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Water dependency (Contextual)
**GRI**: GRI 303 (Contextual)
**CDP**: Water dependency (Contextual)

**Interpretation Notes**
Typically qualitative narrative rather than quantitative metric.

---

### CDI-WATR-20 — Changes in water use patterns

**Intent**
Disclose material changes in water withdrawal, consumption, discharge, or sourcing compared to a prior reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E3 — Changes in water use (Partial)
**GRI**: GRI 303 (Full)
**CDP**: Year-on-year water change (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**
Captures trends and significant operational changes.

---

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require core water withdrawal and consumption disclosure.
- Source granularity requirements vary significantly.
- - Water discharge volume is often conflated with quality or treatment requirements in framework texts.
- Stress context and basin-level analysis are framework-specific.
- Water reuse and recycling definitions lack standardisation.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- This CMP does not cover water quality or discharge standards.
- Sector-specific water disclosures are excluded.
- Jurisdictional water stress requirements are not addressed.
- Interpretations are illustrative and non-authoritative.
- No performance benchmarking is provided.
