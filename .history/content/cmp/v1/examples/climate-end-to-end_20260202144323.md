# End-to-End Climate Disclosure Example

This page presents an illustrative, non-authoritative example demonstrating how the Canonical ESG layers relate to one another in practice.

The example traces a hypothetical climate-related disclosure from canonical data modelling through disclosure intent and framework-specific interpretation.

## Purpose of the Example

This example is provided to:
- illustrate the separation between data, disclosure meaning, and framework interpretation,
- demonstrate traceability across Canonical ESG layers,
- support understanding of the overall architecture.

It is not intended to define best practice, completeness, or correctness.

## What the Example Covers

The example shows:

- Canonical climate data modelled using CERM
- Disclosure meaning expressed using CDI
- Framework-specific interpretation documented using CMP
- Illustrative projection into multiple reporting frameworks

Framework references are included solely for demonstration.

## What the Example Does Not Do

This example does not:
- define reporting requirements,
- determine materiality,
- assert compliance with any standard,
- represent an endorsed interpretation,
- substitute professional judgement.

Users must not rely on this example as compliance guidance.

This example is illustrative only. Canonical ESG makes no representations regarding accuracy, completeness, or regulatory acceptance.

## Cross-Framework Observations

This Canonical Mapping Pack highlights several structural observations across the referenced reporting frameworks.

### Common Disclosure Foundations
All referenced frameworks require disclosure of core greenhouse gas emissions data, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, supported by boundary definitions and methodological explanations. These shared foundations enable a canonical representation of disclosure intent independent of framework-specific presentation.

### Differences in Granularity
Frameworks differ in the level of granularity required. While some require aggregated totals, others request category-level breakdowns, methodological subcomponents, or supplemental narrative detail. The CMP separates core disclosure intent from such extensions.

### Materiality and Applicability
Frameworks apply different materiality concepts and applicability thresholds, particularly for Scope 3 emissions. This CMP documents disclosure intent without determining whether a disclosure is required for a specific reporting entity.

### Separation of Quantity and Method
Several frameworks intertwine quantitative values with methodological explanations. The CMP explicitly separates quantitative disclosure intents from methodological and boundary disclosures to improve clarity and reuse.

### Framework-Specific Procedures
Certain frameworks embed procedural or scoring-related requirements. These are intentionally treated as framework-specific extensions and are not captured as canonical disclosure intents.

## Limitations and Known Gaps

This Canonical Mapping Pack is subject to the following limitations:

### Limited Disclosure Coverage
This CMP covers a defined subset of climate-related disclosure intents for illustrative purposes. It does not represent exhaustive coverage of all climate disclosures across all frameworks.

### Non-Authoritative Interpretation
Mappings documented in this CMP represent a reasoned interpretation of framework texts. They do not constitute authoritative guidance, compliance advice, or official interpretations.

### Framework Evolution
Reporting frameworks evolve over time. This CMP references specific framework versions and may require updates to reflect future revisions.

### Sector and Jurisdictional Specificity
This CMP does not address sector-specific or jurisdiction-specific disclosure requirements. Such requirements may introduce additional disclosure intents or interpretation nuances.

### Exclusion of Performance Evaluation
This CMP does not assess target ambition, performance against targets, or alignment with climate pathways. It focuses solely on disclosure intent and interpretation structure.

## Version History

### v0.1
- Initial publication of Climate CMP
- Covers ten core climate disclosure intents
- Serves as a reference implementation of the Canonical Mapping Pack structure
- Editorially frozen; future updates will be versioned
