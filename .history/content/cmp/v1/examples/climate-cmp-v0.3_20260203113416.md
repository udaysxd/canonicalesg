## Scope Declaration

This Canonical Mapping Pack documents illustrative interpretations of climate-related disclosure intents.

### Topic Scope
- Climate-related disclosures

### Disclosure Intents Covered
CDI-CLIM-01 through CDI-CLIM-32.

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced
- ESRS E1 (2023)  
- GRI 305 (2021)  
- CDP Climate Change Questionnaire (2024)  

### Intended Use

This CMP is provided as an illustrative reference.  
It does not assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

## Interpretation Principles

- Interpretations reflect reasoned professional judgement  
- Framework texts remain authoritative  
- Ambiguity is documented rather than resolved  
- Quantitative, methodological, and governance disclosures are separated  
- No assessment of materiality, sufficiency, or ambition is performed
