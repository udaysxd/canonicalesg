### Intended Use

This CMP is provided as an illustrative reference.  
It does not assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Interpretations documented in this CMP reflect reasoned judgement.
- Framework references are treated as external authoritative texts.
- Ambiguity is documented rather than resolved.
- Quantitative disclosures are separated from methodological disclosures.
- No assessment of materiality or sufficiency is performed.

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

---

### CDI-CLIM-01 — Scope 1 GHG Emissions

**Intent**  
Disclose the organisation’s total direct (Scope 1) greenhouse gas emissions for the reporting period, expressed in CO₂-equivalent.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Gross Scope 1 GHG emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Full

**Interpretation Notes**  
ESRS requires disclosure of gross Scope 1 emissions consistent with GHG Protocol definitions. The CDI intent aligns directly with the quantitative disclosure requirement.

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305-1
- **Mapping Type**: Full

**Interpretation Notes**  
GRI explicitly requires disclosure of Scope 1 emissions. Methodological detail is addressed under CDI-CLIM-10.

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Scope 1 emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Full

**Interpretation Notes**  
CDP requests Scope 1 emissions with additional breakdowns. CDI captures the core disclosure intent.

---

### CDI-CLIM-02 — Scope 2 GHG Emissions

**Intent**  
Disclose the organisation’s total indirect energy-related (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Gross Scope 2 GHG emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Partial

**Interpretation Notes**  
ESRS distinguishes between location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions. CDI-CLIM-02 captures total emissions only.

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305-2
- **Mapping Type**: Partial

**Interpretation Notes**  
GRI requires Scope 2 emissions by method. Methodological distinction is handled under CDI-CLIM-03.

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Scope 2 emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Partial

**Interpretation Notes**  
CDP requires both market-based and location-based figures. CDI captures the aggregate disclosure intent.

---

### CDI-CLIM-03 — Scope 2 Accounting Method

**Intent**  
Disclose the accounting method(s) used for Scope 2 emissions.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Scope 2 methodology
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305-2
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Scope 2 methodology
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-04 — Scope 3 GHG Emissions (Total)

**Intent**  
Disclose the organisation’s total indirect value-chain (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Gross Scope 3 GHG emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Partial

**Interpretation Notes**  
Disclosure is subject to materiality under ESRS. CDI documents the disclosure intent without assessing applicability.

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305-3
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Scope 3 emissions
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-05 — Scope 3 Category Coverage

**Intent**  
Disclose which Scope 3 categories are included or excluded.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Scope 3 categories
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305-3
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Scope 3 categories
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-06 — GHG Emissions Boundary

**Intent**  
Disclose organisational and operational boundaries applied.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Reporting boundary
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305 — Reporting boundary
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Boundary definition
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-07 — Emissions Base Year

**Intent**  
Disclose the base year used for emissions tracking and targets.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Base year disclosures
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305 — Base year
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Base year
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-08 — Emissions Reduction Target

**Intent**  
Disclose emissions reduction targets, including scope coverage.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Reduction targets
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305 — Reduction targets
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Reduction targets
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-09 — Target Year

**Intent**  
Disclose the year(s) by which emissions reductions are intended.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Target timelines
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305 — Target year
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Target year
- **Mapping Type**: Full

---

### CDI-CLIM-10 — Emissions Calculation Methodology

**Intent**  
Disclose methodologies, standards, emission factors, and assumptions used.

#### ESRS
- **Reference**: ESRS E1 — Methodologies and assumptions
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### GRI
- **Reference**: GRI 305 — Methodology
- **Mapping Type**: Full

#### CDP
- **Reference**: Climate Change Questionnaire — Methodology
- **Mapping Type**: Full

## Cross-Framework Observations

This Canonical Mapping Pack highlights several structural observations across the referenced reporting frameworks.

### Common Disclosure Foundations
All referenced frameworks require disclosure of core greenhouse gas emissions data supported by boundary definitions and methodological explanations.

### Differences in Granularity
Frameworks vary in required disclosure granularity. The CMP separates core intent from extensions.

### Materiality and Applicability
Materiality approaches differ across frameworks, particularly for Scope 3 emissions.

### Separation of Quantity and Method
Quantitative values and methodological disclosures are treated as distinct disclosure intents.

### Framework-Specific Procedures
Procedural and scoring requirements are treated as framework-specific extensions.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- This CMP covers a limited set of climate disclosure intents.
- Interpretations are non-authoritative.
- Framework updates may require future revisions.
- Sector- and jurisdiction-specific requirements are not addressed.
- No assessment of performance or ambition is performed.
