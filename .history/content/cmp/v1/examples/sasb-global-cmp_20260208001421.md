# SASB Global Canonical Mapping Pack  
CMP v0.1 — Structurally Complete Cross-Framework Layer

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the cross-framework interpretation layer for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards.

This CMP:

- Operates at Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping
- Interprets SASB Standards against CDI v1 semantic structure
- Does not alter CDI meaning
- Does not assert financial materiality or compliance
- Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

---

## 2. Position Within Canonical ESG Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through three layers:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model  
CDI defines stable disclosure meaning independent of frameworks.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping  
This SASB CMP aligns CDI to SASB Standards.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping  
Regulatory CMPs align CDI to binding legal frameworks.

This CMP does not redefine CDI semantics.
It documents how SASB interprets those semantics at industry level.

---

## 3. Structural Coverage Declaration

This CMP provides structural coverage of:

- All SASB Industry Standards
- All five SASB Topic Families:
  - Environment
  - Social Capital
  - Human Capital
  - Business Model & Innovation
  - Leadership & Governance
- All CDI v1 domains:
  - Environmental
  - Social
  - Governance
  - Economic

No CDI domain is excluded.

---

## 4. SASB Topic Family Mapping Overview

### 4.1 Environment

Mapped to:

- Climate CDIs
- Energy CDIs
- Water CDIs
- Pollution CDIs
- Waste CDIs
- Biodiversity CDIs
- Materials CDIs

SASB environmental accounting metrics map to quantitative CDI metric intents.

---

### 4.2 Human Capital

Mapped to:

- Workforce CDIs

Includes workforce safety, diversity, training, labor relations.

---

### 4.3 Social Capital

Mapped to:

- Consumers & End-Users CDIs
- Affected Communities CDIs
- Value Chain Workers CDIs

Includes product safety, data privacy, access & affordability.

---

### 4.4 Business Model & Innovation

Mapped to:

- Climate transition CDIs
- Materials & lifecycle CDIs
- Governance integration CDIs
- Economic CDIs

Includes lifecycle impacts, supply chain design, innovation metrics.

---

### 4.5 Leadership & Governance

Mapped to:

- Governance CDIs
- Economic CDIs (anti-corruption, compliance, systemic risk)

---

## 5. Regulatory Characteristics

SASB:

- Focuses on financial materiality
- Is industry-specific
- Is investor-oriented
- Uses structured accounting metrics

Materiality logic remains external to CDI.

Industry specificity does not alter CDI semantics.

---

## 6. Interpretation Principles

- CDI defines semantic meaning only.
- SASB defines industry-specific metric requirements.
- Industry specificity does not introduce new semantic domains.
- Financial materiality is framework-specific.
- This CMP does not assert compliance.

---

## 7. Cross-Framework Observations

- SASB and ISSB share financial materiality orientation.
- SASB metrics align structurally with ESRS topical metrics.
- SASB does not introduce new semantic disclosure categories beyond CDI v1.
- Industry-specific metrics operate at CERM metric layer, not CDI semantic layer.

---

## 8. Limitations

- Industry-level granularity is not individually enumerated.
- Technical protocols are not reproduced.
- Sector-specific regulatory overlays are excluded.
- No compliance or financial interpretation is provided.
