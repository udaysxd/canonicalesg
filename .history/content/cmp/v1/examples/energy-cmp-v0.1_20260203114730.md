## Scope Declaration

This CMP documents illustrative interpretations of **energy-related disclosure intents**.

### Topic Scope
- Energy-related disclosures (non-emissions)

### Disclosure Intents Covered

- CDI-ENG-01 — Total energy consumption  
- CDI-ENG-02 — Energy consumption by source  
- CDI-ENG-03 — Renewable energy consumption  
- CDI-ENG-04 — Non-renewable energy consumption  
- CDI-ENG-05 — Energy consumption by geography  
- CDI-ENG-06 — Purchased energy  
- CDI-ENG-07 — Onsite energy generation  
- CDI-ENG-08 — Energy sold or exported  
- CDI-ENG-09 — Energy efficiency initiatives  
- CDI-ENG-10 — Energy intensity metric  
- CDI-ENG-11 — Changes in energy consumption  
- CDI-ENG-12 — Methodology and assumptions for energy data  

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E1 (Energy-related disclosures)
- GRI 302 (Energy)
- CDP Climate Change Questionnaire (Energy section)

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Energy disclosures are treated separately from emissions.
- No validation of renewable claims or performance is performed.

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

---

### CDI-ENG-01 — Total energy consumption

**Intent**  
Disclose the organisation’s total energy consumption for the reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Energy consumption (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Energy consumption (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Captures aggregate energy use independent of source or emissions.

---

### CDI-ENG-02 — Energy consumption by source

**Intent**  
Disclose energy consumption broken down by energy source.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Energy mix (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Energy source breakdown (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Granularity thresholds vary across frameworks.

---

### CDI-ENG-03 — Renewable energy consumption

**Intent**  
Disclose energy consumed from renewable sources.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Renewable energy (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Renewable energy use (Full)

**Interpretation Notes**  
This intent captures quantities only and does not validate renewable attributes.

---

### CDI-ENG-04 — Non-renewable energy consumption

**Intent**  
Disclose energy consumed from non-renewable sources.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Non-renewable energy (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Non-renewable energy use (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-05 — Energy consumption by geography

**Intent**  
Disclose energy consumption by geographic location.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Geographic breakdown (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Geographic energy data (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Often required conditionally or for material locations.

---

### CDI-ENG-06 — Purchased energy

**Intent**  
Disclose energy purchased from external suppliers.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Purchased energy (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Full)  
**CDP**: Purchased energy (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-07 — Onsite energy generation

**Intent**  
Disclose energy generated by the organisation for its own use.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Self-generated energy (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-1 (Partial)  
**CDP**: Onsite generation (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-08 — Energy sold or exported

**Intent**  
Disclose energy generated and sold or exported externally.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Energy sold (Contextual)  
**GRI**: GRI 302 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Energy sold/exported (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Typically relevant for energy producers or prosumers.

---

### CDI-ENG-09 — Energy efficiency initiatives

**Intent**  
Disclose initiatives undertaken to improve energy efficiency.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Energy efficiency actions (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-4 (Full)  
**CDP**: Energy efficiency initiatives (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-10 — Energy intensity metric

**Intent**  
Disclose energy consumption normalised by a relevant activity metric.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Energy intensity (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-3 (Full)  
**CDP**: Energy intensity (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-11 — Changes in energy consumption

**Intent**  
Disclose changes in energy consumption compared to a prior period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Changes in energy use (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 302-4 (Full)  
**CDP**: Year-on-year energy change (Full)

---

### CDI-ENG-12 — Methodology and assumptions for energy data

**Intent**  
Disclose methodologies, boundaries, and assumptions used in energy reporting.

**ESRS**: ESRS E1 — Methodology and assumptions (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 302 — Methodology (Full)  
**CDP**: Methodology and assumptions (Full)

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require core energy consumption disclosure.
- Granularity requirements vary significantly.
- Energy disclosures are often conflated with emissions; CMP enforces separation.
- Verification and attribute validation are framework-specific.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- This CMP does not cover sector-specific energy disclosures.
- Jurisdictional requirements are excluded.
- Interpretations are illustrative and non-authoritative.
- No performance benchmarking is provided.
