European Union Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack
CMP v0.1 — Structurally Complete Jurisdiction Layer

This Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP) documents the jurisdiction-level interpretation layer for sustainability disclosures under the European Union regulatory framework.

This CMP:

Operates at Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Interprets EU legal architecture against CDI v1 semantic structure

Does not alter CDI meaning

Does not assert legal compliance

Is non-authoritative and infrastructure-oriented

1. CMP Metadata

CMP Name: European Union Jurisdiction Canonical Mapping Pack

CMP ID: eu-cmp

CMP Version: v0.1

Status: Frozen Reference Implementation

Publication Date: 2026-02-03

Maintainer: Canonical ESG

License: CC BY 4.0

CDI Version Referenced: CDI v1

CMP Type: Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction: European Union

Legal Status: Mandatory (CSRD)

2. Legal Architecture Covered

This CMP reflects the structure and disclosure architecture of:

Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)

European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)

Including:

ESRS 1 – General Requirements

ESRS 2 – General Disclosures

ESRS E1–E5 (Environmental Standards)

ESRS S1–S4 (Social Standards)

ESRS G1 (Governance Standard)

Sector-specific ESRS standards are excluded from this version.

3. Position Within Canonical ESG Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through three layers:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model

CDI defines stable disclosure meaning independent of framework or law.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

Topic CMPs interpret CDI across voluntary/global frameworks.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

This EU CMP aligns CDI to binding EU regulatory requirements.

This CMP does not redefine CDI semantics.
It documents how EU law requires disclosure of those semantics.

4. Structural Completeness Declaration

This CMP provides full structural coverage of:

ESRS cross-cutting disclosures (ESRS 1 & 2)

ESRS topical standards (E1–E5, S1–S4, G1)

All CDI v1 domains

No CDI domain is excluded at jurisdiction layer.

5. ESRS Cross-Cutting Architecture Mapping

The following ESRS cross-cutting components are structurally mapped:

Governance (GOV)

GOV-1 — Governance bodies and sustainability oversight

GOV-2 — Management roles and responsibilities

Mapped to Governance CDIs.

Strategy and Business Model (SBM)

SBM-1 — Strategy and business model integration

SBM-2 — Impacts, risks, and opportunities

SBM-3 — Material impacts, risks and opportunities interaction

Mapped across Governance and domain-specific CDIs.

Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IRO)

IRO-1 — Description of double materiality assessment process

IRO-2 — Sustainability matters identified as material

IRO-3 — Interaction with financial position and performance

Mapped across all environmental and social CDIs.

Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR)

MDR-P — Policies

MDR-A — Actions and resources

MDR-T — Targets

MDR-M — Metrics

Mapped structurally across all CDI domains.

6. ESRS Topical Standards — Domain Hooks

This CMP includes structural mapping hooks for:

Environmental Domains
ESRS E1 — Climate Change

Mapped to:

Climate CDIs (CDI-CLIM-01 → CDI-CLIM-32)

ESRS E2 — Pollution

Mapped to:

Pollution CDIs (CDI-POLL-01 → CDI-POLL-16)

ESRS E3 — Water and Marine Resources

Mapped to:

Water CDIs

ESRS E4 — Biodiversity and Ecosystems

Mapped to:

Biodiversity CDIs (CDI-BIOD-01 → CDI-BIOD-18)

ESRS E5 — Resource Use and Circular Economy

Mapped to:

Materials & Circularity CDIs (CDI-MATR-01 → CDI-MATR-20)

Waste CDIs

Social Domains
ESRS S1 — Own Workforce

Mapped to:

Workforce CDIs (CDI-WORK-01 → CDI-WORK-22)

ESRS S2 — Workers in the Value Chain

Mapped to:

Value Chain Workers CDIs

ESRS S3 — Affected Communities

Mapped to:

Affected Communities CDIs

ESRS S4 — Consumers and End-Users

Mapped to:

Consumers & End-Users CDIs

Governance Domain
ESRS G1 — Business Conduct

Mapped to:

Governance CDIs (CDI-GOVR series)

7. Regulatory Characteristics (Jurisdiction-Specific)
7.1 Double Materiality

EU reporting requires:

Impact materiality

Financial materiality

Materiality logic is regulatory and external to CDI semantics.

7.2 Value Chain Scope

EU reporting may extend beyond operational boundaries into:

Upstream activities

Downstream activities

CERM boundaries remain neutral.
Jurisdiction CMP specifies regulatory extension.

7.3 Assurance

CSRD requires:

Limited assurance initially

Potential progression to reasonable assurance

Assurance requirements are regulatory, not semantic.

7.4 Phased Application

Application depends on:

Entity size

Listing status

Reporting year

Phasing logic is outside CDI.

7.5 Digital Tagging

EU requires structured digital tagging under ESEF/XBRL.

Digital tagging is not embedded in CDI semantics.

8. Domain Coverage (CDI v1 Complete)

This CMP covers all CDI v1 domains:

Environmental:

Climate

Energy

Water

Waste

Pollution

Biodiversity

Materials & Circularity

Social:

Workforce

Value Chain Workers

Affected Communities

Consumers & End-Users

Governance:

Governance

No CDI domain is excluded at jurisdiction layer.

9. Interpretation Principles

CDI defines semantic meaning only.

EU law defines disclosure obligation.

This CMP does not assert legal compliance.

Mapping reflects ESRS structural architecture.

Double materiality remains jurisdiction-specific.

Regulatory extensions do not alter CDI meaning.

No legal interpretation is provided.

10. Cross-Domain Observations

ESRS integrates governance across all domains.

Narrative disclosure requirements are extensive.

Value chain reporting is structurally broader than many global standards.

ESRS tightly integrates policy, action, target, and metric disclosures.

Digital tagging introduces structured reporting obligations not present in CDI.

11. Limitations

Sector-specific ESRS standards are excluded.

EU Taxonomy alignment disclosures are excluded.

Digital tagging technical schemas are not represented.

Legal compliance determinations are outside scope.

Regulatory interpretation is not provided.
