    intended_use: Regulatory alignment modelling for EU Taxonomy classification and Article 8 disclosures.

  interpretation_principles:
    - CDI semantics remain unchanged.
    - EU Taxonomy classification is mapped at jurisdiction level only.
    - DNSH is modelled as cross-domain protection logic.
    - Minimum safeguards are interpreted via governance and social CDIs.
    - Financial alignment metrics are mapped to Economic CDIs.
