    intended_use: >
      Infrastructure-level interpretation of EU sustainability reporting
      obligations under CSRD and ESRS, mapped to Canonical Disclosure
      Intents (CDI v1). This CMP is illustrative and non-authoritative.

  interpretation_principles:
    - CDI semantics remain framework independent.
    - EU reporting obligations arise from CSRD and ESRS.
    - Double materiality is a regulatory construct external to CDI.
    - Value chain scope extends beyond operational boundary.
    - Assurance requirements are jurisdiction-specific.
    - No legal interpretation or compliance assertion is made.

  mappings: []

  cross_framework_observations:
    - EU introduces mandatory double materiality assessment.
    - EU requires structured digital tagging under ESEF.
    - ESRS integrates governance disclosures across domains.
    - Phased implementation applies based on company size and listing status.

  limitations:
    - Sector-specific ESRS standards are excluded.
    - EU Taxonomy alignment is not mapped.
    - Digital tagging implementation details are not modelled.
    - Interpretations are non-authoritative.
    - Legal compliance determinations are outside scope.
