      Infrastructure-level interpretation of EU sustainability reporting obligations.

  interpretation_principles:
    - CDI semantics remain framework independent.
    - EU obligations arise from CSRD and ESRS.
    - Double materiality is jurisdiction-specific.
    - Value chain scope is broader than operational scope.
    - Assurance requirements are regulatory.
    - No legal interpretation is asserted.

  mappings: []

  cross_framework_observations:
    - EU introduces mandatory double materiality.
    - EU requires digital tagging.
    - EU integrates governance across domains.
    - Phased implementation applies.

  limitations:
    - Sector-specific ESRS standards excluded.
    - EU Taxonomy alignment not mapped.
    - Digital tagging not modelled.
    - Non-authoritative interpretation.
