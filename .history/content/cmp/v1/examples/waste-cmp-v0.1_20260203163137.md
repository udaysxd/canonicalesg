## Scope Declaration

This CMP documents illustrative interpretations of **waste-related disclosure intents**.

### Topic Scope
- Waste-related disclosures (operational waste outputs)

### Disclosure Intents Covered

- CDI-WSTE-01 — Total waste generated
- CDI-WSTE-02 — Waste generated by operational boundary
- CDI-WSTE-03 — Waste by material or category
- CDI-WSTE-04 — Waste classified as hazardous or non-hazardous
- CDI-WSTE-05 — Waste sent to disposal
- CDI-WSTE-06 — Waste sent to recycling
- CDI-WSTE-07 — Waste sent to recovery or energy recovery
- CDI-WSTE-08 — Waste sent to reuse
- CDI-WSTE-09 — Waste destination by type
- CDI-WSTE-13 — Waste intensity metric
- CDI-WSTE-18 — Changes in waste generation or treatment patterns
- CDI-WSTE-19 — Operational dependency on specific waste treatment routes

### Reporting Frameworks Referenced

- ESRS E5 (Resource Use and Circular Economy)
- GRI 306 (Waste)
- CDP Waste-related disclosures (where applicable)

### Intended Use

This CMP is illustrative only.  
It does **not** assert compliance, completeness, or authoritative interpretation.

---

## Interpretation Principles

- Disclosure intent is defined exclusively by CDI.
- Framework texts remain the authoritative source.
- Interpretive judgement is explicitly documented.
- Waste is treated as an operational output stream.
- No validation of hazardous classification, regulatory compliance, or circularity performance is performed.

## Disclosure Intent Mappings

---

### CDI-WSTE-01 — Total waste generated

**Intent**  
Disclose the total quantity of waste generated during the reporting period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Total waste generated (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 306-3 (Full)  
**CDP**: Waste generation (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Captures aggregate waste generation independent of destination or classification.

---

### CDI-WSTE-02 — Waste generated by operational boundary

**Intent**  
Disclose waste generation disaggregated by organisational or operational boundary.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Boundary breakdown (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Operational scope (Contextual)

---

### CDI-WSTE-03 — Waste by material or category

**Intent**  
Disclose waste generation disaggregated by material type or category.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Waste categories (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306-4 (Full)  
**CDP**: Waste composition (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-04 — Waste classified as hazardous or non-hazardous

**Intent**  
Disclose waste generation disaggregated by hazardous or non-hazardous classification.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Hazardous waste (Full)  
**GRI**: GRI 306-4 (Full)  
**CDP**: Hazardous waste (Partial)

**Interpretation Notes**  
Classification thresholds and definitions vary by jurisdiction and framework.

---

### CDI-WSTE-05 — Waste sent to disposal

**Intent**  
Disclose waste directed to disposal routes.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Disposal (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306-5 (Full)  
**CDP**: Waste disposal (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-06 — Waste sent to recycling

**Intent**  
Disclose waste directed to recycling processes.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Recycling (Partial)

**CDP**: Recycling (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-07 — Waste sent to recovery or energy recovery

**Intent**  
Disclose waste directed to recovery or energy recovery processes.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Recovery (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Recovery (Contextual)

---

### CDI-WSTE-08 — Waste sent to reuse

**Intent**  
Disclose waste directed to reuse pathways without reprocessing.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Reuse (Contextual)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Reuse (Contextual)

---

### CDI-WSTE-09 — Waste destination by type

**Intent**  
Disclose waste disaggregated by destination or treatment outcome.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Treatment breakdown (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306-5 (Full)  
**CDP**: Treatment type (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-13 — Waste intensity metric

**Intent**  
Disclose waste generated normalised by a relevant activity or output metric.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Waste intensity (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Waste intensity (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-18 — Changes in waste generation or treatment patterns

**Intent**  
Disclose material changes in waste generation, composition, or treatment compared to a prior period.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Changes over time (Partial)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Full)  
**CDP**: Year-on-year change (Partial)

---

### CDI-WSTE-19 — Operational dependency on specific waste treatment routes

**Intent**  
Disclose dependency on specific waste treatment or disposal routes for continued operations.

**ESRS**: ESRS E5 — Dependency (Contextual)  
**GRI**: GRI 306 (Contextual)  
**CDP**: Dependency (Contextual)

## Cross-Framework Observations

- All frameworks require disclosure of total waste generated.
- Treatment and destination granularity varies significantly.
- Hazardous waste definitions differ by jurisdiction.
- Circular economy concepts are embedded unevenly across frameworks.

---

## Limitations and Known Gaps

- This CMP does not cover pollution impacts or toxicity.
- Regulatory compliance and permitting are excluded.
- Sector-specific waste disclosures are not addressed.
- Interpretations are illustrative and non-authoritative.
- No performance benchmarking is provided.
