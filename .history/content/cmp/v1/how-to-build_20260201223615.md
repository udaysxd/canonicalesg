# How to Build a Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP)

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This document provides practical guidance for **building, maintaining, and reviewing a Canonical Mapping Pack (CMP)**.

It is intended for:
- sustainability consultants,
- assurance professionals,
- internal ESG and reporting teams,
- organisations supporting multi-framework sustainability reporting.

This guide does **not** provide compliance advice and does **not** interpret reporting standards authoritatively.

---

## 2. What a CMP Is (and Is Not)

### 2.1 What a CMP Is

A CMP is a **documented interpretation artefact** that:
- relates Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs) to specific reporting framework requirements,
- makes professional judgement explicit,
- supports reuse of disclosure meaning across frameworks,
- enables auditability and review.

CMPs are **framework-facing**, not data-facing.

---

### 2.2 What a CMP Is Not

A CMP is **not**:
- a compliance checklist,
- a scoring or validation mechanism,
- an automated reporting engine,
- an endorsed interpretation of a standard.

CMPs document interpretation; they do not replace professional judgement.

---

## 3. Preconditions for Building a CMP

Before creating a CMP, the following should be in place:

1. Familiarity with the relevant reporting framework(s)
2. Understanding of Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)
3. Awareness of the Canonical ESG Reference Model (CERM)
4. Clarity on the scope and purpose of the CMP

CMPs should not be created in isolation from subject-matter expertise.

---

## 4. Defining CMP Scope

Each CMP must begin by clearly defining its scope.

### 4.1 Scope Dimensions

Scope should be declared across the following dimensions:

- **Topic scope** (e.g. climate only)
- **Framework scope** (e.g. ESRS E1, GRI 305)
- **Version scope** (specific standard versions)
- **Jurisdictional assumptions** (if any)
- **Sectoral focus** (if applicable)

Explicit scoping prevents misuse and over-reliance.

---

## 5. Selecting Disclosure Intents

CMPs map **from disclosure intent to framework requirement**.

### 5.1 Intent Selection

- Identify relevant CDI identifiers from the CDI taxonomy
- Do not redefine or merge intents
- Exclude intents that are out of scope and document exclusions

Each selected CDI becomes a mapping anchor.

---

## 6. Identifying Framework References

For each selected CDI:

1. Identify relevant framework clauses, questions, or sections
2. Reference the exact framework version
3. Avoid paraphrasing standard text unnecessarily

Framework references are external artefacts and may change over time.

---

## 7. Creating Mapping Units

### 7.1 Mapping Structure

Each mapping unit should include:
- CDI identifier
- Framework reference(s)
- Mapping type (e.g. full, partial, contextual)
- Interpretation notes

Mappings may be one-to-one or one-to-many.

---

### 7.2 Mapping Types

Common mapping types include:
- **Full** — the framework requirement fully consumes the disclosure intent
- **Partial** — the requirement covers part of the intent
- **Contextual** — the intent supports the requirement indirectly

Mapping type must be declared explicitly.

---

## 8. Documenting Interpretation Notes

### 8.1 Purpose

Interpretation notes make **professional judgement visible**.

They explain:
- why a mapping exists,
- how alignment was determined,
- where ambiguity remains.

---

### 8.2 When Interpretation Notes Are Required

Interpretation notes are required when:
- a framework requirement only partially aligns with a CDI,
- conditional logic applies,
- multiple intents relate to a single requirement,
- standard language is ambiguous.

Avoid implicit or undocumented judgement.

---

## 9. Declaring Limitations and Gaps

CMPs must include a section documenting:
- known gaps in coverage,
- unresolved interpretation questions,
- framework areas not addressed,
- assumptions that may not hold universally.

This section protects users and reviewers from over-reliance.

---

## 10. Versioning and Maintenance

### 10.1 Versioning

CMPs must be versioned.
Version changes should reflect:
- framework updates,
- changes in interpretation,
- scope expansion or reduction.

---

### 10.2 Maintenance Expectations

CMPs are **living artefacts**.
Maintainers should:
- monitor framework updates,
- review mappings periodically,
- publish updated versions when necessary.

Outdated CMPs should be clearly marked.

---

## 11. Quality Indicators for CMPs

A high-quality CMP demonstrates:
- clear scope declaration,
- explicit interpretation notes,
- consistent use of CDI identifiers,
- transparent limitations,
- alignment with CMP design principles.

Completeness is less important than clarity and honesty.

---

## 12. Relationship to Assurance

CMPs support assurance by:
- enabling traceability,
- exposing interpretation choices,
- reducing undocumented assumptions.

CMPs do not replace assurance procedures or professional judgement.

---

## 13. Ethical and Professional Considerations

CMP authors should:
- avoid claims of authority or endorsement,
- avoid implying compliance or sufficiency,
- disclose conflicts of interest where relevant,
- respect intellectual property of standards bodies.

Professional integrity is essential to CMP credibility.

---

## 14. Summary

Building a Canonical Mapping Pack is a **structured professional activity** that documents how disclosure meaning is interpreted across reporting frameworks.

By following this guide, practitioners can create CMPs that are transparent, reusable, auditable, and compatible with evolving sustainability reporting landscapes—without creating shadow standards or compliance mechanisms.
