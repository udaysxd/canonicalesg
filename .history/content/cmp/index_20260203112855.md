# Canonical Mapping Packs (CMP)

Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) document how **Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs)** are interpreted by specific sustainability reporting frameworks.

CMPs make interpretation explicit, transparent, and reviewable — without asserting authority, compliance, or endorsement.

They answer the question:

> *How does a reporting framework interpret a given disclosure intent?*

CMPs do **not** define what must be disclosed, how data should be calculated, or whether a disclosure is sufficient.

## Purpose of CMP

Sustainability reporting frameworks often request similar disclosures using different:
- terminology,
- structure,
- scope,
- aggregation rules,
- presentation formats.

Interpreting these requirements involves professional judgement.

CMPs exist to:

- document interpretation decisions explicitly,
- make assumptions and limitations visible,
- reduce undocumented and inconsistent interpretation,
- support reuse of disclosure meaning across frameworks,
- improve traceability and auditability of reported information.

CMPs are **non-authoritative interpretation artefacts**.

---

## Relationship to Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDI)

Canonical Mapping Packs are explicitly anchored to **Canonical Disclosure Intents (CDIs)**.

Each CMP:
- references one or more CDI identifiers,
- does not redefine disclosure meaning,
- documents how existing disclosure intent is interpreted by a specific reporting framework.

CDIs provide the **stable semantic layer** that enables CMPs to be versioned, reviewed, and compared even as reporting frameworks evolve.

## Position in Canonical ESG

Canonical ESG separates sustainability reporting concerns into three layers:

- **CERM** defines *how sustainability data is structured*
- **CDI** defines *what a disclosure means*
- **CMP** documents *how disclosure meaning maps to specific frameworks*

CMPs sit at the boundary between **semantic meaning** and **framework-specific requirements**.

They must not modify or extend CERM or CDI.

---

## CMP Domains

CMPs are organised by sustainability topic domain.

Each domain may have one or more CMPs, depending on framework coverage and versioning.

---

## Climate Canonical Mapping Packs

Climate CMPs document interpretations of **climate-related disclosure intents**, including:

- governance and strategy disclosures,
- climate-related risks and opportunities,
- policies and commitments,
- targets and transition planning,
- greenhouse gas emissions,
- energy and mitigation actions,
- methodology and assumptions.

Climate CMPs reference **Climate CDIs (CDI v1)** and map them to frameworks such as:
- ESRS E1,
- GRI 305,
- CDP Climate Change questionnaires.

## Energy Canonical Mapping Packs

Energy CMPs document interpretations of **energy-related disclosure intents**, including:

- energy consumption,
- energy sources and mix,
- energy procurement and generation,
- energy intensity and efficiency,
- energy boundaries and methodologies.

Energy CMPs reference **Energy CDIs (CDI v1)** and map them to energy-related requirements in sustainability reporting frameworks and energy standards.

Energy CMPs are distinct from climate CMPs and do not address greenhouse gas emissions.

## What CMPs Do and Do Not Do

### CMPs Do

- Map Canonical Disclosure Intents to framework requirements
- Document interpretation choices and assumptions
- Enable traceability and review
- Support consistency across reporting outputs
- Allow multiple interpretations to coexist transparently

### CMPs Do Not

- Define reporting obligations
- Determine materiality
- Assert compliance or sufficiency
- Replace professional judgement
- Provide regulatory or assurance advice

---

## Status and Versioning

CMPs are versioned artefacts.

Each CMP documents:
- the CDI version referenced,
- the reporting framework version interpreted,
- known limitations and gaps,
- a clear change history.

Frozen CMPs remain referenceable for historical use.

---

## Non-Authority Statement

CMPs:
- are not endorsed by any standards-setting body,
- do not represent official interpretations,
- do not carry regulatory or legal authority.

All use of CMPs requires professional judgement.
