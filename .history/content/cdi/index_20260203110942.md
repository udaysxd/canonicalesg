## Energy Disclosure Intents

Energy Disclosure Intents (Energy CDIs) define the semantic meaning of energy-related sustainability disclosures.

Energy CDIs cover:
- energy consumption,
- energy sources and mix,
- energy procurement and generation,
- energy intensity and efficiency,
- energy boundaries and methodologies.

Energy CDIs are:
- independent of greenhouse gas accounting,
- framework-agnostic,
- non-authoritative,
- designed for reuse across reporting standards via Canonical Mapping Packs.

The Energy CDI taxonomy is frozen as **CDI v1**.
