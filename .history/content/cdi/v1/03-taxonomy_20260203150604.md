# CDI Taxonomy Overview

## 1. Purpose

This document provides an overview of the **Canonical Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy structure** for CDI v1.

The CDI taxonomy defines stable, framework-independent disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested sustainability information across global reporting frameworks.

Each **domain** within the CDI taxonomy maintains its own dedicated taxonomy document. This separation enables:
- independent domain evolution,
- clear domain boundaries,
- extensibility for new sustainability topics.

## 2. Taxonomy Principles

The CDI taxonomy follows these cross-domain principles:

### 2.1 Independence from Reporting Standards
- CDIs are independent of any reporting standard or framework.
- CDIs do not prescribe disclosure obligations.
- CDIs do not assert completeness or compliance.
- Framework-specific interpretations are handled exclusively through Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

### 2.2 Semantic Stability
- Each CDI represents a single semantic concept.
- CDI identifiers are stable across versions.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.
- New CDIs are added through explicit versioning.

### 2.3 Structural Consistency
Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

### 2.4 Non-Exhaustiveness
- The taxonomy is **non-exhaustive** and may be extended.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.
- Domains may be added as new sustainability topics emerge.

## 3. Domain Taxonomies

Each CDI domain maintains its own taxonomy documentation:

### Climate Taxonomy
Defines disclosure intents for climate-related sustainability disclosures.

Includes governance, strategy, risks, targets, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, and methodology.

→ [View Climate Taxonomy](/cdi/v1/taxonomy/climate)

### Energy Taxonomy
Defines disclosure intents for energy-related sustainability disclosures.

Includes energy consumption, sources, procurement, intensity, efficiency, and methodology.

→ [View Energy Taxonomy](/cdi/v1/taxonomy/energy)


### Water Taxonomy
Defines disclosure intents for water-related sustainability disclosures.

Focuses on water as an operational resource, including withdrawal, consumption, discharge, sourcing, reuse, and management.

→ [View Water Taxonomy](/cdi/v1/taxonomy/water)

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Across all domains, the CDI taxonomy exhibits these characteristics:

- **Framework Independence**: CDIs are defined without reference to specific reporting frameworks.
- **Semantic Precision**: Each CDI captures a single, well-defined disclosure intent.
- **Reusability**: CDIs can be mapped to multiple framework requirements via CMPs.
- **Version Safety**: CDI identifiers remain stable; changes are versioned explicitly.
- **Historical Reference**: Deprecated CDIs remain available for historical disclosures.

## 5. Relationship to CMP

Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs) document how CDIs are interpreted by specific reporting frameworks.

- CDIs define *what* is being disclosed (semantic meaning).
- CMPs document *how* that disclosure intent maps to framework requirements.
- The stability of CDIs ensures that CMPs remain comparable even as frameworks evolve.

## 6. Summary

The CDI v1 taxonomy is organised by domain, with each domain maintaining its own dedicated documentation.

This structure supports:
- clear domain boundaries,
- independent evolution,
- extensibility for new sustainability topics,
- long-term stability and auditability.

Each domain taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing sustainability disclosure meaning across reporting frameworks.
