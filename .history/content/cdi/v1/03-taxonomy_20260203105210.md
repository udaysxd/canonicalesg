# Climate Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Climate Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for climate-related sustainability disclosures.

The taxonomy enumerates a stable set of disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested climate information across global reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of any reporting standard,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assert completeness or compliance,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Climate disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Governance & Strategy**
2. **Risks & Opportunities**
3. **Policies & Commitments**
4. **Targets & Transition Planning**
5. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**
6. **Energy & Mitigation Actions**
7. **Performance & Progress**
8. **Methodology & Assumptions**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- The taxonomy is **non-exhaustive** and may be extended.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.
- Framework-specific nuance is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Climate Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing climate-related disclosure meaning across reporting frameworks.

By collapsing diverse and evolving disclosure requirements into a manageable set of intents, the taxonomy enables organisations to model climate disclosures once and reuse them globally without loss of meaning.

# Energy Taxonomy

## 6. Purpose

This section defines the **Energy Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for energy-related sustainability disclosures.

The Energy taxonomy captures the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested energy information across global reporting frameworks, energy management standards, and sustainability disclosures.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of emissions accounting frameworks,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not validate renewable or efficiency claims,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Energy CDIs focus on **energy flows, sources, intensity, and management**, not on greenhouse gas outcomes.

---

## 7. Taxonomy Structure

Energy disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Energy Consumption**
2. **Energy Sources & Mix**
3. **Energy Procurement & Generation**
4. **Energy Intensity & Efficiency**
5. **Energy Boundaries & Methodology**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 9. Energy Taxonomy Characteristics

- Energy CDIs are **distinct from climate and emissions CDIs**.
- Energy CDIs may be used independently or alongside Climate CDIs.
- Framework-specific interpretations are handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Energy CDIs do not determine renewable eligibility, compliance, or claims validity.
- Deprecated Energy CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 10. Summary

The CDI v1 Energy Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing energy-related disclosure meaning across reporting frameworks and energy standards.

By separating energy disclosures from emissions outcomes, the taxonomy enables clearer data modelling, improved reuse, and transparent interpretation without conflating energy use with climate impact.
