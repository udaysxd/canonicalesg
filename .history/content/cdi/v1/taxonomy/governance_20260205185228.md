# Governance Disclosure Intent Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Governance Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for sustainability-related governance disclosures within Canonical ESG.

The Governance taxonomy captures the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested information about how sustainability-related matters are governed within an organisation, independent of any specific reporting framework or regulation.

The taxonomy:
- is framework-agnostic,
- does not prescribe governance obligations,
- does not assess governance quality or effectiveness,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Governance CDIs focus on **structures, roles, responsibilities, and processes**, not outcomes, performance, or ethical judgement.

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Governance disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Oversight Structure**
2. **Roles & Responsibilities**
3. **Governance Processes**
4. **Policies & Commitments**
5. **Reporting Scope & Methodology**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- is primarily narrative or structural,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

**CDI-GOVR-14**  
**Changes in governance structure or processes**

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- Governance CDIs describe **existence and structure**, not effectiveness.
- Governance CDIs do **not** assess outcomes, performance, or ethical quality.
- Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.
- Framework-specific interpretation is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated Governance CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Governance Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing how sustainability-related matters are governed within an organisation.

By separating governance structure from governance judgement, the taxonomy enables transparent, reusable disclosure mapping across reporting frameworks while preserving organisational and regulatory neutrality.
