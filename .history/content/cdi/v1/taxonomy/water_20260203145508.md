# Water Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section will define the **Water Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for water-related sustainability disclosures.

The Water taxonomy will capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested water information across global reporting frameworks, water management standards, and sustainability disclosures.

The taxonomy will:
- be independent of any specific water standard or regulation,
- not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- not validate water quality, sufficiency, or stewardship claims,
- be intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Water CDIs will focus on **water flows, sources, usage, quality, and management**, not on broader environmental or social outcomes.

---

## 2. Scope

The Water Taxonomy for CDI v1 is planned to address:

- Water consumption and withdrawal,
- Water sources and stress contexts,
- Water quality and discharge,
- Water efficiency and conservation,
- Water-related risks and dependencies,
- Water governance and management.

---

## 3. Status

The Water Disclosure Intent taxonomy is **not yet defined for CDI v1**.

This document serves as a placeholder for future development. Individual Water CDIs will be introduced in subsequent updates once the domain scope has been fully specified and reviewed.

*Status: Draft / Pending*  
*Target version: CDI v1.x or CDI v2*

---

## 4. Exclusions

The Water Taxonomy will explicitly exclude:

- Marine and ocean disclosures (covered separately),
- Water-related climate adaptation (covered in Climate CDIs),
- Regulatory compliance determinations,
- Water quality standards or thresholds.
