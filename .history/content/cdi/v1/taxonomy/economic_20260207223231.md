Economic Sustainability Taxonomy
1. Purpose

This section defines the Economic Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy for economic sustainability disclosures within Canonical ESG.

The Economic taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information relating to:

economic performance,

value creation and distribution,

financial interaction with sustainability impacts,

market presence,

indirect economic impacts,

procurement practices,

public policy contributions,

anti-competitive conduct.

The taxonomy:

is framework-agnostic,

does not prescribe economic reporting obligations,

does not embed accounting standards,

does not assert financial materiality,

does not encode regulatory interpretation,

is intended for reuse across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Economic CDIs describe economic structure, flows, exposure, and impact, not financial statement compliance.

2. Taxonomy Structure

Economic disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

Economic Performance & Value Distribution

Financial Interaction with Sustainability

Market Presence & Local Economic Effects

Indirect Economic Impacts

Procurement & Supply Chain Economics

Public Policy & Economic Transparency

Anti-Competitive Behaviour

Economic Methodology & Scope

Each disclosure intent:

has a unique identifier,

represents a single semantic concept,

may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,

remains independent of accounting frameworks,

may reference canonical elements (Metric, Boundary, Time Period, etc.).

3. Economic Disclosure Intents

4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Economic CDIs are independent of financial accounting standards.

CDIs do not embed IFRS, GAAP, or ESRS logic.

CDIs do not assert financial materiality.

CDIs do not encode regulatory thresholds.

Each CDI may map to multiple frameworks via CMPs.

Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

5. Structural Alignment Capability

This Economic Taxonomy enables structural mapping to:

• GRI 200 series
• ESRS financial interaction disclosures
• ISSB financial materiality architecture
• Jurisdiction-level economic reporting requirements

without embedding regulatory semantics into CDI.

6. Summary

The CDI Economic Taxonomy defines a stable semantic vocabulary for modelling economic sustainability disclosures.

By separating economic structure and financial interaction from regulatory interpretation and accounting standards, the taxonomy enables:

• full GRI coverage
• ESRS structural completeness
• ISSB financial materiality compatibility
• global cross-framework reuse
• jurisdictional alignment without semantic drift
