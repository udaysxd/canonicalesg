# Pollution Disclosure Intent Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Pollution Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for pollution-related sustainability disclosures.

The Pollution taxonomy enumerates a stable set of disclosure intents that capture the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested pollution-related information across sustainability reporting frameworks.

The taxonomy:
- is independent of any reporting standard or regulation,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not assert compliance, legality, or environmental impact,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Pollution CDIs describe **non-greenhouse-gas emissions and releases** resulting from organisational activities.

---

## 2. Taxonomy Structure

Pollution disclosure intents are grouped into the following logical domains:

1. **Air Emissions (Non-GHG)**
2. **Water Pollution**
3. **Soil and Land Pollution**
4. **Sources and Processes**
5. **Management and Monitoring**
6. **Incidents and Accidental Releases**
7. **Change Over Time**

Each disclosure intent:
- has a unique identifier,
- represents a single semantic concept,
- may be narrative, quantitative, or hybrid,
- may reference one or more canonical data elements.

## 3. Pollution Disclosure Intents

### 3.1 Air Emissions (Non-GHG)

**CDI-POLL-01**  
**Non-greenhouse gas air pollutant emissions**  
> Emissions of air pollutants other than greenhouse gases resulting from organisational activities.

**CDI-POLL-02**  
**Air pollutant emissions by category**  
> Air pollutant emissions disaggregated by pollutant category (e.g. particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides).

---

### 3.2 Water Pollution

**CDI-POLL-03**  
**Pollutants discharged to water**  
> Discharge of pollutants to water bodies or water systems resulting from organisational activities.

**CDI-POLL-04**  
**Water pollutant discharge by category**  
> Water pollutant discharges disaggregated by pollutant category.

---

### 3.3 Soil and Land Pollution

**CDI-POLL-05**  
**Pollutants released to soil or land**  
> Releases of pollutants to soil or land resulting from organisational activities.

**CDI-POLL-06**  
**Contamination of land from operational activities**  
> Occurrence of land or soil contamination associated with organisational operations.

---

### 3.4 Sources and Processes

**CDI-POLL-07**  
**Operational sources of pollution**  
> Identification of operational activities or processes that generate pollution.

**CDI-POLL-08**  
**Pollution associated with production or processing activities**  
> Pollution arising specifically from production, processing, or treatment activities.

---

### 3.5 Management and Monitoring

**CDI-POLL-09**  
**Existence of pollution-related policies or controls**  
> The existence of organisational policies, controls, or procedures addressing pollution.

**CDI-POLL-10**  
**Pollution monitoring and measurement processes**  
> Processes used to monitor, measure, or track pollution-related releases.

**CDI-POLL-11**  
**Use of pollution control or abatement technologies**  
> Use of technologies or measures intended to control or reduce pollution.

---

### 3.6 Incidents and Accidental Releases

**CDI-POLL-12**  
**Accidental pollution releases or spills**  
> Occurrence of accidental or unplanned pollution releases, spills, or leaks.

**CDI-POLL-13**  
**Response to pollution incidents**  
> Actions taken in response to accidental pollution releases or incidents.

---

### 3.7 Change Over Time

**CDI-POLL-14**  
**Changes in pollution emissions or releases**  
> Changes in pollution emissions or releases compared to a prior reporting period.

**CDI-POLL-15**  
**Changes in pollution sources or processes**  
> Changes in the sources or operational processes associated with pollution over time.

**CDI-POLL-16**  
**Changes in pollution management practices**  
> Changes in pollution-related policies, controls, or management practices over time.

---

## 4. Taxonomy Characteristics

- Pollution CDIs are **distinct from climate and greenhouse gas emissions CDIs**.
- Pollution CDIs focus on releases and emissions, not regulatory compliance or impact severity.
- Quantitative disclosures may describe amounts or volumes without thresholds or limits.
- Framework-specific interpretation is handled exclusively through CMPs.
- Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

---

## 5. Summary

The CDI v1 Pollution Taxonomy defines a **stable semantic vocabulary** for expressing pollution-related disclosure meaning across sustainability reporting frameworks.

By separating pollution releases from compliance, impact assessment, and regulatory judgement, the taxonomy enables consistent data modelling, transparent interpretation, and long-term reuse without embedding assumptions or thresholds.

## Pollution CDI v1 Status

The Pollution Disclosure Intent taxonomy defined in this document is **frozen as CDI v1**.

No new Pollution CDIs will be added to v1.  
Future extensions will require a new major version.

*Status: Frozen*  
*Effective version: CDI v1*
