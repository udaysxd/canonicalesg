# Water Disclosure Intent Taxonomy

## 1. Purpose

This section defines the **Water Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy** for water-related sustainability disclosures within Canonical ESG.

The Water taxonomy captures the *semantic meaning* of commonly requested water-related information across sustainability reporting frameworks, independent of any specific standard or regulation.

The taxonomy:
- is framework-agnostic,
- does not prescribe disclosure obligations,
- does not validate environmental performance or stewardship claims,
- is intended to be reused across frameworks via Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

Water CDIs focus on **water as an operational resource**, not on environmental impact, ecosystem outcomes, or regulatory compliance.

---

## 2. Scope

The Water Disclosure Intent taxonomy addresses disclosure intents related to:

- Water withdrawal and consumption,
- Water sourcing and supply,
- Water discharge,
- Water reuse and recycling,
- Water-related operational dependencies,
- Water management practices and measurement processes.

The taxonomy is limited to **descriptive disclosure meaning** and does not imply materiality, risk, or impact.

---

## 3. Status

The Water Disclosure Intent taxonomy is defined as a **draft domain for CDI v1**.

Individual Water CDIs will be enumerated and versioned within this domain following the standard CDI change control and freeze process.

*Status: Draft*  
*Version: CDI v1*

---

## 4. Exclusions

The Water Disclosure Intent taxonomy explicitly excludes:

- Water stress, scarcity, or risk assessment,
- Ecosystem, biodiversity, or habitat impacts,
- Water quality standards, thresholds, or classifications,
- Regulatory compliance determinations,
- Climate adaptation or resilience considerations.

These topics are addressed, where applicable, in other CDI domains or through framework-specific interpretation in CMPs.
