Value Chain Workers Disclosure Intent Taxonomy
1. Purpose

This section defines the Value Chain Workers Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy for sustainability-related disclosures concerning workers in an organisation’s upstream or downstream value chain.

The taxonomy captures the semantic meaning of commonly requested information related to labour conditions beyond the organisation’s own workforce.

The taxonomy:

is framework-agnostic,

does not prescribe obligations,

does not assert compliance,

does not evaluate adequacy or fairness.
