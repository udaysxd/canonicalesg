CDI Taxonomy Overview
1. Purpose

This document provides an overview of the Canonical Disclosure Intent (CDI) taxonomy structure for CDI v1.

The CDI taxonomy defines stable, framework-independent disclosure intents that capture the semantic meaning of commonly requested sustainability information across global reporting frameworks.

Each domain within the CDI taxonomy maintains its own dedicated taxonomy document. This separation enables:

independent domain evolution,

clear domain boundaries,

extensibility for new sustainability topics.

2. Taxonomy Principles

The CDI taxonomy follows these cross-domain principles:

2.1 Independence from Reporting Standards

CDIs are independent of any reporting standard or framework.

CDIs do not prescribe disclosure obligations.

CDIs do not assert completeness or compliance.

Framework-specific interpretations are handled exclusively through Canonical Mapping Packs (CMPs).

2.2 Semantic Stability

Each CDI represents a single semantic concept.

CDI identifiers are stable across versions.

Deprecated CDIs remain referenceable for historical disclosures.

New CDIs are added only through formal version updates.

2.3 Structural Consistency

Each disclosure intent:

has a unique identifier,

represents a single semantic concept,

may be quantitative, narrative, or hybrid,

may reference one or more canonical data elements.

2.4 Non-Exhaustiveness

The taxonomy is extensible through new domains.

Each CDI may map to multiple framework requirements.

Domains may be added as new sustainability topics emerge.

Extensions do not alter the semantic meaning of existing CDIs.

3. Domain Taxonomies

The CDI v1 taxonomy is structured across three high-level categories:

Environmental Domains
Climate Taxonomy

Governance, strategy, risks, targets, greenhouse gas emissions, energy interactions, transition planning, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/climate

Energy Taxonomy

Energy consumption, sourcing, procurement, intensity, efficiency initiatives, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/energy

Water Taxonomy

Water withdrawal, consumption, discharge, sourcing, reuse, water stress context, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/water

Waste Taxonomy

Operational waste generation, classification, treatment pathways, recovery, disposal, and methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/waste

Pollution Taxonomy

Non-GHG air emissions, water pollutants, soil contamination, operational sources, monitoring, and incident handling.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/pollution

Biodiversity Taxonomy

Organisational interaction with natural areas, land use, ecosystem dependencies, biodiversity management processes, and change over time.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/biodiversity

Materials and Circularity Taxonomy

Material inputs, throughput, recycled/secondary materials, efficiency, recovery practices, and materials governance.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/materials

Social Domains
Workforce Taxonomy

Organisation’s own workforce composition, employment structure, training, health & safety, worker representation, governance, and reporting methodology.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/workforce

Value Chain Workers Taxonomy

Workers in upstream and downstream value chains, including employment conditions, labour practices, health & safety, and management processes.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/value-chain-workers

Affected Communities Taxonomy

Communities impacted by organisational activities, including engagement processes, impact identification, and grievance mechanisms.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/affected-communities

Consumers and End-Users Taxonomy

Impacts on consumers or end-users, including product safety, information transparency, data protection, and complaint mechanisms.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/consumers

Governance Domain
Governance Taxonomy

Governance oversight, roles and responsibilities, governance processes, policy architecture, risk integration, ethics, internal controls, and reporting scope.

→ /cdi/v1/taxonomy/governance

4. Taxonomy Characteristics

Across all domains, the CDI taxonomy exhibits:

Framework Independence

Semantic Precision

Reusability through CMP

Version Safety

Historical Traceability

Domain Isolation with Cross-Domain Interoperability

CDIs define meaning.
CMPs define interpretation.
Jurisdiction CMPs define regulatory alignment.

5. Three-Layer Architecture

Canonical ESG operates through a layered structure:

Layer 1 — Semantic Model

CDI defines stable disclosure meaning.

Layer 2 — Cross-Framework Mapping

CMPs interpret CDIs across voluntary and global frameworks.

Layer 3 — Jurisdictional Mapping

Jurisdiction CMPs map CDIs to legal and regulatory obligations.

This layered separation ensures long-term interoperability across evolving sustainability standards.

6. Summary

The CDI v1 taxonomy establishes a complete semantic foundation for environmental, social, and governance disclosures.

Each domain defines a stable vocabulary for modelling sustainability information independent of frameworks or regulation.

This structure enables:

single-source semantic modelling,

multi-framework reuse,

jurisdictional alignment without semantic drift,

long-term stability across regulatory evolution.
