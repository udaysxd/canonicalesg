  "description": "Structural layer for framework interpretation, mapping rules, and non-authoritative positioning relative to external standards without defining actual framework mappings.",
  "purpose": "CMP establishes the architectural framework for interpreting external disclosure standards (GRI, SASB, ESRS, TCFD, etc.) and mapping them to Canonical ESG structures, while explicitly maintaining non-authoritative positioning and structural independence.",
  "responsibilities": [
    "Define structural approach to external framework interpretation without asserting specific mappings",
    "Establish mapping rule types without implementing them for specific standards",
    "Maintain explicit non-authoritative positioning relative to external standards",
    "Define structural independence rules—external frameworks do not alter CERM/CDI definitions",
    "Establish evolution rules for managing external framework version changes",
    "Preserve formal separation between canonical architecture and external standard content"

    "CMP does not assert that Canonical ESG definitions supersede external standards",
    "CMP does not claim authoritative interpretation of GRI, SASB, ESRS, TCFD, or other frameworks",
    "CMP mappings are structural convenience, not standard-setting",

  "evolution_rules": [
    "CMP major version: Breaking changes to mapping rule structures or independence principles",
    "CMP minor version: Additive changes (new mapping rule types, new framework categories) without breaking existing mappings",

    "External framework updates (GRI 2021 to 2024, ESRS changes) do not automatically change CMP version",
