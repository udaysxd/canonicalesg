  "description": "Presentation and disclosure layer defining structural formats for sustainability reports, annexes, and statement formats without including sample disclosures or illustrative metrics.",
  "purpose": "SSS establishes the structural framework for presenting sustainability disclosures in formal, structured formats including the main disclosure document and supporting annexes, while strictly avoiding instance data, example values, or illustrative content.",
  "responsibilities": [
    "Define structured statement formats for sustainability disclosures",
    "Specify field-level mappings to CDI intents",
    "Document presentation roles and data types for each field",
    "Maintain format-only discipline without creating disclosure obligations",
    "Establish table structures and column definitions without sample data"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "SSS defines structure only—no sample disclosures",
    "SSS does not include example metric values",
    "SSS does not provide illustrative narratives",
