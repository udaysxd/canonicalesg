  "description": "Structural layer defining disclosure intent, constraints, and architectural positioning without asserting authoritative mappings or disclosure concept definitions.",
  "purpose": "CDI establishes the structural framework for expressing disclosure requirements, constraints, and intended audiences without defining actual disclosure concepts or asserting authoritative mappings to external standards.",
  "responsibilities": [
    "Define structural slots for disclosure intent without populating them with disclosure concepts",
    "Establish constraint types that may govern disclosure (materiality, jurisdiction, sector, etc.)",
    "Specify intended audience categories without prescribing content",
    "Define structural relationship to CERM without asserting data values",
    "Establish versioning independence from external frameworks",
    "Maintain formal separation from authoritative standard-setting"

  "constraints": [
    "CDI does not define disclosure concepts—only their structural placement",
